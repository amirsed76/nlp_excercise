You the nigga with the GED.\\n\\nHipster girl: I still don\\'t understand why they say \"word.\"\\nHipster guy: Well, I think it\\'s because they don\\'t know what word to use.

Rigor mortis.\\n\\nMom: Excuse me, Mr. Chocolate Chocolate Chip Muffin, that\\'s a little revisionist, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nMailwoman: Give me some of the cheese. No, not that, the American...the Americano...the yellow stuff. I don\\'t worry about no gym so you can put more than that on. You\\'re skinny, I\\'m fat. I can tell you don\\'t love that cheese.\\nWoman: You know, I can make a pork chop taste like chicken.\\nFlyer guy: Hey, you want a coupon for a Spicy Chicken? It comes with free fries! You know you want free fries! Hey, smile, it\\'s good for your aura!\\nSlavic girl: I cannot stand Americans who come to the opera smelling like hamburgers.\\nTeen girl: Oh my god.

Shit, she has nice tits.\\n\\nTeen boy: Yo, Zach, I thought of a new Michael J. Fox joke. So, you go into a Verizon and start shaking and they go, \"Who do you think you are?

Cancer cures smoking. Think about it.\\nGirl: I coughed it up and everything was better.\\nModel guy: ...I know, jaundice is so in now.\\nGirl on cell: So she\\'s still smoking in your apartment?

You should tell her that for every cigarette she smokes during the day, you\\'ll put one out on her while she sleeps.\\nGirl: See this weird thing that showed up on my leg in Africa? Kind of looks like ringworm.\\nGuy: I\\'ve been using paper towel to blow my nose and now it\\'s all chapped.

It\\'s nasty.\\nGuy: You can put sneakers in the oven, but that don\\'t make them biscuits.\\nQueer: ...and he stretched, but he was obviously doing it so his shirt would ride up so he could show off how much weight he\\'d lost, and I was like, \"Ugh, that\\'s not coming anywhere near area.\"\\nDude: People react differently to me in a suit.

It looks like she poured herself into her pantyhose.\\nStore guy: I have been a bartender and a waiter but I have never been the host. There is no way to estimate how long it will take to fit someone\\'s breast into a bra. This is an art, not a science, people!\\nSecurity guy: I\\'m surprise I haven\\'t seen nobody wearing shorts.\\nWoman: You know, there is something to be said for dressing seasonally. Seasonably? Whatever. I mean, it\\'s cool if you want to wear a tube top to the bar or whatever, but when girls are going out in these little tube tops, wear a jacket! You know? No outfit is cool unless you\\'re comfortable in it. To a degree.\\nCrazy guy: I\\'m poor! I\\'m poor! I\\'m poor! I\\'m poor! Won\\'t somebody please buy me a pair of dungarees?

You were never a fuck machine, and I certainly did know how to fake it.\\n\\nDude: Yo, I\\'m tired of this shit. I ain\\'t fuckin\\' no girl behind no nigga\\'s back....at least not that I know of.\\nGuy: But you were disappointed that you didn\\'t get molested. Admit it...Oh my god, that was a joke!

That\\'s all right, God bless\\nyou...even the Chinese girl.\\nHobo: The tax man has a licence to kill. No questions asked. More people should know that.\\nHobo: If you see a suspicious black package on this train do not pick it up . If you see a large, black package on my seat after I leave, do worry. It is not a bomb . I\\'ve been riding this train for fifteen years. Leave it for the Coney island clean-up crew. They\\'ll take care of it. It is not a weapon, it is not filled with hundred dollar bills, just don\\'t it...Did you know that Union Square is a hundred years older than Times Square?\\nHobo: Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the interruption. I am trying to raise one million dollars and 25 cents for wine research.\\nHobo: All you people who just got on the train, everybody in this car already gave me $7.

You remember what they did? Printing our home address and pictures of Mommy and us half nude ? I will never pay for the New York Times . Remember how Mommy got letters from convicts? Because they\\'re the only ones who have enough time to read the entire New York Times . Mommy will never give them a dime! They\\'re lucky I didn\\'t sue!\\nGirl: Not really, all they want to do is stay in my apartment and order delivery. They\\'re from the suburbs and don\\'t have delivery there.\\nChick: I thought this was the ghetto, but I haven\\'t seen, like, a single black person.\\nMom: Honey, this train station is very crowded. That is why they call it Grand Central Station.\\nTourist chick: Oh, so this is where it to be.\\nChick: wow, the down escalator is so much easier than the up one.\\nCrazy guy: Shit, I like the Natural History Museum. But I\\'d like it better if there were whores all around it.\\nGirl: I couldn\\'t ever take the train into work and have to deal with all the people. The trains are dirty, crowded, and takes a long time to get anywhere. That\\'s the beauty of living in New York; you don\\'t have to deal with those things.\\nGuy: So I was down on Canal, buying some of that perfume my wife likes for Valentine\\'s. Some of that Chanel; usually it\\'s $45 a bottle! But I talked this guy down to $25.

That\\'s the other thing I hate about winter.\\nMan: I used to like it when I was a child, but then I was molested.\\nProfessor lady: Well, did you all know that Osama bin Laden was one of about 50 children? That could actually explain some things about him, you know, not getting enough attention as a child. Maybe if he had been one of three instead, we wouldn\\'t have so many problems, ha, ha, ha!...Please don\\'t repeat this to anyone.\\nDude: For real, dog, all I\\'m saying is that, she want to be with me, she gots to get rid of them kids. I ain\\'t playing with no kids.\\nMom: People steal children out of this place every single day of the year.\\nHippie man: You ever notice how all the kids who walk to school smoke?

There are no normal women in this city left to date. Sorry for my language.\\nDrunk girl: Let me put it this way: I didn\\'t want to be hooking up with him I was hooking up with him. I started, and then I got stuck.\\nBlack man: ...but I remember you. You spent the night at my house\\nand didn\\'t have sex.\\nGirl: He was really hot, wasn\\'t he? I got his number but I\\'m not going to call him for at least 3 days.\\nGirl on cell: It was an okay date, but we just talked about our cats, and I was like, \" isn\\'t sexy.\"\\nLady on phone: Yes, I\\'m having dinner with him tonight...Really?...He didn\\'t say anything about handcuffs.\\nWoman: Yeah, he cooked dinner for me. I thought, \"Finally a good nice sensitive guy.\" Until this Lolita shows up in the living room. \"Hey Dad, I\\'m here for the weekend. Who\\'s this?\"\\nGuy: I can either have a dog or a girlfriend. I can\\'t afford both.\\n\\nQueer: Hey, the red is looking really good on you. That\\'s gonna be the next color of my living room walls, like God had a nosebleed!\\n\\nGuy: Take a black man home, surprise your family.\\nGirl: Saturday was a day from Hell. I have no recollection of Saturday, because that was the day my dad said I had to choose...between a Cherokee and a Renegade. Now, the Cherokee was white, and the Renegade was green, and they had, like, completely different features. And finally, I chose the Cherokee, and for that I blame my mom, because I think she pressured me into taking a car I didn\\'t really want, when what I wanted was the best features of both of them in one vehicle.\\nWoman: My favorite color is green...because, uh...it looks like trees.\\nMom: Imagine if you were black. Wouldn\\'t you feel invisible?\\nSuit: So, do we have to wear bright red underwear to his birthday party again this year?\\nTeen girl on cell: I didn\\'t want to take the bus because it takes forever, but I also didn\\'t see a train coming from the black hole...\\nQueer: She must have been white because if she was Puerto Rican, she would have slapped me!\"\\nMom: You already black; just go out at night.\\n\\nGirl: I feel like if your vagina is wet enough, you won\\'t get AIDS.\\n\\nMan: Fucking shit doors.
