"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States cannot unilaterally cancel the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Friday in reaction to President Donald Trump’s decision not to certify the accord. “We cannot afford as the international community to dismantle a nuclear agreement that is working,” said Mogherini, who chaired the final stages of the landmark talks. “This deal is not a bilateral agreement ... The international community, and the European Union with it, has clearly indicated that the deal is, and will, continue to be in place,” Mogherini told reporters. Mogherini said she spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson immediately after Trump’s speech on Friday. ",politicsNews,0
"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Even if President Donald Trump wins an appeal of a court ruling blocking his executive order on sanctuary cities, arguments made by the government in the case could permanently harm its  efforts to cut off wide swaths of federal funding to targeted cities, some legal experts say. Trump’s original order, issued on Jan. 25, stated that cities and counties shielding illegal immigrants and refusing to cooperate with immigration officials would lose federal funding except for that “deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes.”  U.S. Justice Department attorneys defending the order in a San Francisco court presented a far narrower view of its reach, however, arguing before U.S. District Judge William Orrick III earlier this month that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs. * COMMENTARY: Why Trump should mend ties with Russia reut.rs/2qiISqU * COMMENTARY: Russia investigation teeters, but Trump’s strategy of stonewalling does not reut.rs/2oxuHll     That argument did not convince the judge on Tuesday, who noted in issuing a preliminary injunction that the text of the executive order threatened withdrawal of a much wider range of federal funds than the government attorneys asserted in court. [nL1N1HX23B]     “Disavowing the plain language of the executive order itself” was a potentially dangerous course for the Justice Department, said Edward Waters, a Washington lawyer who specializes in federal grants.  The government’s strategy could restrict its ability to cut off funds going forward, some legal experts said, since the Justice Department now has said the order applies to a narrow range of funding.  Trump has promised to broadly “defund” sanctuary cities, saying they “breed crime.” The government could appeal the preliminary injunction to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the losing side at the appellate level could then appeal to the Supreme Court. One procedural case the federal government could make on appeal involves the timing of the challenge, some legal scholars suggested, but such an argument would have limitations. Since no federal funds actually have been withheld to date, the government could say there has been no harm and therefore the case is not yet “ripe” for litigation, said Brian Galle, an expert on government finance at Georgetown Law. To have standing to bring a case, San Francisco and Santa Clara County would have to have suffered actual harm, which could be difficult to establish in this case since they have so far lost no federal funding. [nL1N1FL1GW]     The two municipalities successfully argued in the district court hearing that they had already been harmed by uncertainty and chaos in their budget planning but that might not convince an appellate court.     “In the very short run it’s quite possible that the administration could win a reversal of this ruling” on appeal because of these procedural reasons, Galle said. He predicted, however, the administration would be unable to successfully defend itself if it then began withholding funds without Congress authorizing such action.  The Justice Department declined to discuss its appeals strategy.     Tuesday’s ruling left leeway for the administration to deny some kinds of funding to sanctuary cities, noting the government can “use lawful means to enforce existing conditions of federal grants.” A small amount of federal law enforcement money is tied to a statute requiring local jurisdictions to share information with federal immigration officials.     Programs making such grants include the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, Community Oriented Policing Services, and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. In San Francisco, such funding is a small fraction of federal monies that go to the city, said City Attorney Dennis Herrera. Tuesday’s ruling was the latest legal blow to the Trump administration, which has had two previous executive orders stayed by the courts. In February, a Washington court blocked a Trump order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from seven mostly Muslim nations. A subsequent order replaced that one, removing Iraq from the ban and creating more exemptions. Parts of that ban were also blocked, this time by judges in Maryland and Hawaii.[nL2N1GS0XF] Those cases are pending appeal. After Tuesday’s district court ruling, a spokesman for the Department of Justice said that it “will follow the law with respect to regulation of sanctuary jurisdictions.”  But the president made clear on Twitter Wednesday that he doesn’t consider the battle over: “See you in the Supreme Court!” he tweeted.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to shake up Washington and as president the brash real estate mogul will be in a position to dramatically change how the United States handles immigration, trade and a range of other policies. Yet many of his more ambitious proposals will require cooperation from Congress. While he will likely enjoy a post-election honeymoon with congressional Republicans, a long-lasting romance is far from guaranteed, given his uneasy relationship with congressional leaders and some basic ideological differences he has with Republican orthodoxy. Following is an overview of Trump’s top domestic policy plans, based on the sometimes vague details of his agenda, and their likelihood of success: In his campaign, Trump argued that international trade agreements had hurt U.S. workers and the country’s competitiveness. He has promised to “get tough” on China, withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which is still not finalized, and renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada.  As president, Trump does have some power to raise tariffs on countries such as China. He could delay the TPP, as well, even if Congress approves it. Economists have warned that such moves would damage the economy by forcing consumers to pay dramatically higher prices on everything from refrigerators to T-shirts. U.S. exports, such as airplanes and soybeans, would likely suffer as well.      On the campaign trail, Trump has promised to build a wall along the Mexican border, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban immigration from countries that have been “compromised by terrorism.”  Those policies would not come cheap. Trump has estimated the wall would cost $8 billion to $12 billion. Other estimates have run much higher. Politico estimated it would cost at least $166 billion to deport all of those in the country illegally and complete a border wall. While many congressional Republicans support those policies, they might blanch at the cost. Trump has said he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but he has no power to force another country to spend money on something it does not want.  More broadly, Trump could shift the broader debate over immigration, empowering skeptics like Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who want to reduce overall immigration levels and reduce the number of skilled guest workers. That would be a blow to business groups and Hispanic advocates who have sought to relax immigration laws. Trump has promised to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and replace it with a plan that would give states more control over the Medicaid health plan for the poor and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. He would need Congress to act, and Republicans could have difficulty getting the 60 votes needed to advance a repeal effort through the 100-seat Senate. Republicans could face a public backlash if they repeal a law that has provided healthcare to millions of Americans. A Trump administration would have plenty of other opportunities to undermine Obamacare, however, by appointing officials who are not committed to its success. Trump has vowed to make deep tax cuts, while also promising to protect popular health and retirement programs that account for more than a third of U.S. government spending. That combination of policies would massively increase the national debt, according to the nonpartisan Center for a Responsible Budget. He has also proposed increasing spending on the military and infrastructure, but has said he would reduce spending on categories other than health and retirement by 1 percent each year. On taxes, he would get plenty of help from Republicans in Congress, who have been laying the groundwork for a tax-code overhaul that would lower rates and close loopholes. But they will encounter fierce resistance from homeowners, businesses and other interest groups that benefit from current tax breaks. Trump’s promise to protect entitlement programs will rile fiscal conservatives, who worry they will swamp the federal budget in the decades to come. But those programs are popular with the American public. Trump has promised a “dismantling” of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details. The Republican Party’s platform calls for reinstating Glass-Steagall, the 1930s-era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit-taking institutions. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said in July that his campaign backed that change. Republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most-despised pieces of the Dodd-Frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to Glass-Steagall. Trump has offered few details about his plans to fight Islamic State but has said he would “knock the hell out of” the militant group. He says he is keeping the details of his strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. Trump has said if he wins, he would give U.S. generals 30 days after he takes office on Jan. 20 to propose their own plans. Trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria, and instead has said he would create “safe zones” there, which he says would be funded by Gulf states. Obama has said a safe zone in Syria would require a large U.S. military commitment, something that could prove to be unpopular with Americans weary of lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump has said he would have a “very, very good” relationship with Russia.  Trump has said could work with Russia to combat Islamic State. He also said he would look into recognizing Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia imposed by Western nations for what they called an illegal land grab. Trump has criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying some U.S. allies have not met their defense commitments. In July, he said if Russia attacked a NATO member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense. NATO leaders say the sanctions against Russia are key to persuading it to change that country’s behavior in Ukraine, where it has backed ethnic Russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism. With one vacancy on the Supreme Court and several more likely in the coming four years, Trump will have a chance to put a conservative stamp on the nation’s courts for decades to come. His list of potential nominees has won praise from conservative activists and Republicans in the Senate, who will be eager to help him in that area. ",politicsNews,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to slash funding for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service and other financial regulators passed a key committee in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a long partisan fight. The expansive legislation would also place a halt on the payday lending restrictions that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently proposed. The Appropriations Committee voted 30-17 to approve the bill allocating funds for financial services and general government, which now goes to the full House. One of the committee’s senior Democrats, Jose Serrano of New York, warned that the “bill in its current form will be vetoed.”  The Senate must still pass accompanying legislation. After that, both chambers will reconcile their bills into a single piece for President Barack Obama to sign or veto. Congress has tangled over budget laws for years, and federal agencies frequently rely on temporary continuing resolutions for funding. Republicans cast the bill as a way to streamline agencies and hold them accountable for spending decisions, while saving taxpayer money. Democrats attacked what they called “riders” to the bill, such as a measure to stop the Federal Communications Commission’s net neutrality rule and one to prevent corporations from being required to disclose political donations. They also said cuts to the SEC would hobble the agency in carrying out its duties and implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Earlier this month the CFPB, charged with shielding consumers from financial fraud, proposed rules to limit short-term borrowings known as “payday” loans, which can charge interest as high as 390 percent. Critics say the proposal will cut off credit to poor people who may need small loans during emergencies. Representative Steven Palazzo, a Mississippi Republican, proposed an amendment on Thursday to delay implementing the rules until the bureau reports to Congress on their possible effects, saying he was concerned they could force people to turn to loan sharks.  Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz had been one of the few members of her party to oppose the rules, and had sponsored a bill to delay CFPB rules for two years.  Wasserman Schultz, who is also a U.S. representative from Florida, reversed her position in the last week. She told the hearing on Thursday the proposal is “inarguably a step in the right direction,” adding, “I stand with the CFPB in its efforts to protect Americans from predatory lending.”  ",politicsNews,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission wants to rollback landmark media ownership regulations that prohibit owning a television station and newspaper in the same market and making it easier to acquire additional TV or radio stations, Chairman Ajit Pai said on Wednesday. If approved at the FCC’s November meeting, the move would be a win for newspapers and broadcasters that have pushed for the change for decades, but was criticized by Democrats who said it could usher in a new era of media consolidation. The FCC in 1975 banned cross-ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market, unless it granted a waiver, to ensure a diversity of opinions. The rule was made before the explosion of internet and cable news and Republican President Donald Trump and Pai have vowed to reduce government regulation. “We must stop the federal government from intervening in the news business,” Pai told a congressional panel, noting that many newspapers have closed and many radio and TV stations are struggling. Pai moved earlier this year to make it easier for some companies to own a larger number of local stations.  Pai said the marketplace no longer justifies the rules, citing Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) dominance of internet advertising. “Online competition for the collection and distribution of news is greater than ever. And just two internet companies claim 100 percent of recent online advertising growth; indeed, their digital ad revenue this year alone will be greater than the market cap of the entire broadcasting industry,” Pai said. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said at the hearing Wednesday the move would lead to further consolidation in the media business and should be opposed. There are three Republicans and two Democrats on the panel. Pai also proposes to make it easier for companies to own multiple TV and radio stations in the same market and he would allow two local stations among the top four in a market to petition the FCC to merge. The Pew Research Center said in June total weekday circulation for U.S. daily newspapers fell 8 percent in 2016, marking the 28th consecutive year of declines, while Sunday circulation declined to 38 million, the lowest levels since 1945. Newspaper ad revenue in 2016 fell to $18 billion, down from $49 billion in 2006. News Media Alliance Chief Executive David Chavern said newspapers need economies of scale to complete. He praised Pai’s move, saying the current rules “do not make sense, particularly when newspapers compete with countless sources of news and information every day.” The National Association of Broadcasters said it backs Pai’s plan, noting that policymakers have approved numerous “mega-mergers” among phone, cable and satellite programmers “while at the same time blocking broadcast/newspaper or radio/TV combinations in single markets.” The group added “this nonsensical regulatory approach has harmed the economic underpinning of newspapers, reduced local journalism jobs, and punished free and local broadcasters at the expense of our pay TV and radio competitors.” Free Press, an advocacy group, said the proposal would make it easier for Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (SBGI.O) to complete its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co (TRCO.N) with fewer divestitures. The “disastrous proposal is tailor-made for Sinclair and other giant broadcast chains that push often slanted or cookie-cutter content over the public airwaves,” the group said. ",politicsNews,0
"KABUL (Reuters) - A leaked memo from an staff member in Afghan President Ashraf Ghani s office this week has set off a storm of criticism and accusations that the note lays bare systematic favoritism to Ghani s own Pashtun ethnic group. The undated memo, about appointments in the Administrative Office of the President (AOP), appeared to show jobs being awarded with an eye to keeping control in the hands of Pashtuns while giving the appearance of diversity. The leak has caused severe embarrassment to Ghani s fragile government, which has long faced criticism that it favors Pashtuns, traditionally the most powerful among a patchwork of different ethnic groups in Afghanistan, including Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks.  The leak may well be the tip of the iceberg,  wrote Amrullah Saleh, a former head of the National Directorate for Security who is close to Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah from the mainly Tajik Jamiat-i-Islami party. In a post on Facebook, Saleh said the memo showed how a  clique  was consolidating power through a  soft purge  involving  indirect intimidation, faking identities and the marginalization of  others .  The memo, by a senior staff member at the AOP, was initially shared with a limited number of people on a messaging platform, apparently by mistake before finding its way to the daily newspaper Etilaat Roz this week.  Tajiks and Uzbeks, who work completely under us, should be appointed symbolically so that people think every ethnicity is represented here,  it said. At another point it mentions an official, saying he is  a good person but he brings in Hazaras and appoints them to top positions. We have to look for Pashtuns who are fluent in all languages.  The official who posted the memo on the messaging platform  has resigned and the AOP issued a statement saying it was  a personal document sent by one of its staff and does not represent the overall policy of the office.   Shah Hussain Mortazawi, a spokesman for Ghani, also rejected the memo, saying there was no place for ethnic discrimination in the government. However it set off a storm of angry comment on social media and from influential figures like Saleh and another former intelligence chief, Rahmatullah Nabil, highlighting simmering resentments within the government camp less than a year before parliamentary elections due in July. The administration Ghani heads was painstakingly put together after disputed elections in 2014 when both he and his main opponent Abdullah claimed victory amid accusations of massive cheating on both sides. A U.S.-brokered power sharing deal left Ghani as President with Abdullah alongside as Chief Executive. But from the start the government has been beset by disputes over appointments being carved up on ethnic lines. ",worldnews,0
"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump went around and over the “Great Firewall” of China in a late-night tweet in Beijing as he thanked his hosts for a rare tour of the Forbidden City and a private dinner at the sprawling, centuries-old palace complex.  Many Western social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are banned in China. A sophisticated system has been built to deny online users within China access to blocked content.  That was not an issue for Trump, known for tweeting to his 42.3 million followers at any hour of the day, on Wednesday, the day he arrived in Beijing. “On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania and I, THANK YOU for an unforgettable afternoon and evening at the Forbidden City in Beijing, President Xi and Madame Peng Liyuan. We are looking forward to rejoining you tomorrow morning!” Trump even changed his Twitter banner, uploading a photograph of himself and Melania with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, during a Chinese opera performance at the Forbidden City.  The Twitter banner upload did not go unnoticed by Chinese state media, with state broadcaster CCTV flashing screenshots of the photograph on Thursday. Trump’s visit was also the third-most talked-about topic on Chinese social media platform Weibo over the last 24 hours, trailing only the birthday of a singer in a Chinese boy band and a weekly Asian pop song chart.  Many people wondered how Trump managed to evade China’s tough internet controls.  “I guess he must have done it via wifi on a satellite network,” said a user on Weibo. Many foreigners log on to virtual private networks (VPNs) to access content hosted outside of China. Another option is to sign up for a data-roaming service before leaving one’s home country.  “The president will tweet whatever he wants. That’s his way of communicating directly with the American people. Why not?” a White House official said ahead of Trump’s arrival in Beijing on Wednesday.  When asked whether China considers Trump’s use of Twitter to be in breach of Chinese law, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said there were many means of communication with “the outside world”.  “In China, people have many channels to communicate, it’s just that they communicate in different ways,” Hua said at a regular ministry briefing. “For example, some people use WeChat, some people use Weibo. Some people use Apple phones, some people use Huawei phones.” Trump tweeted again on Thursday afternoon, posting an ABC News video montage of the “incredible” welcome parade at the Great Hall of the People, where he was greeted by a military band and jumping, flag-waving children.  In his tweet, Trump embedded a link to a photograph of his Beijing visit on Instagram - also forbidden in China.  Not all of Trump’s tweets in China were bright and cheerful.  “NoKo has interpreted America’s past restraint as weakness,” he tweeted about reclusive North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats. “This would be a fatal miscalculation. Do not underestimate us. AND DO NOT TRY US.”  ",politicsNews,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday delayed voting on a Republican tax overhaul as the bill was tripped up by problems with an amendment sought by fiscal hawks to address a large expansion of the federal budget deficit projected to result from the measure. The Senate debated the legislation late into Thursday and adjourned, putting off any votes until Friday morning. It was unclear if a decisive vote on the bill would occur then. The delay underscored nagging concerns among Republican fiscal conservatives about the deficit impact of the bill. That set up the possibility that its deep tax cuts might have to be moderated, that future tax increases might be built in, and that some conservatives might seek to attach spending cuts, all approaches that could throw up new political problems. White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told reporters in the Capitol: “I don’t think tax cuts are going to be scaled back. I think it would still be historic tax relief for corporations and for middle-income families.”  The tax bill is seen by Republicans as crucial to their prospects in the November 2018 elections, when they will fight to keep control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump and  Republicans now in control of Congress have yet to pass major legislation, a fact they hope to change with their proposed tax- code overhaul, which would be the biggest since the 1980s. Democrats, expected to unanimously oppose the tax bill, have dismissed it as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations. Republican Senator Bob Corker and others had tried to add a provision to the bill to trigger automatic future tax increases if the tax cuts in the bill did not boost the economy and generate revenues sufficient to offset the deficit expansion. But the Senate parliamentarian barred Corker’s “trigger” proposal on procedural grounds. The trigger amendment was needed to win Corker’s vote and those of others worried about the deficit - worries that intensified when congressional analysts said the bill would not boost the economy enough to offset the estimated deficit expansion, as the Trump administration had said it would. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told reporters in the Capitol that it had not been easy to accommodate Corker, Senator Jeff Flake and other fiscal hawks. “It’s been pretty hard to make them happy so far. We’re going to keep working on it ... and we’re going to do it,” Hatch said. Senate Republicans were considering making a proposed corporate income tax rate cut temporary, instead of permanent, so the rate would rise back to an unknown level after six or seven years, said one Republican senator and an aide. By that time, Trump might no longer be in office and a future Congress might change the law. When asked if the tax bill was in trouble, Republican Senator Mike Rounds told reporters: “No, I don’t think so. It’s just a matter of once again trying to make the bill work.” Optimism had reigned earlier in the day, when the bill won the backing of Republican Senator John McCain. Stocks surged on hopes that a key tax overhaul vote was imminent. The S&P 500 hit a record closing high and the Dow Jones industrial average topped the 24,000 mark for the first time. But the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, a nonpartisan fiscal analysis unit of Congress, said the bill as passed earlier by the Senate Finance Committee, would generate only $407 billion in new tax revenue from increased economic growth. JCT had earlier estimated the tax bill would balloon the $20 trillion national debt by $1.4 trillion over 10 years. The new estimate, counting “dynamic” economic effects, put the deficit expansion at $1 trillion, far short of assertions by some Republicans that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the new JCT estimate showed “no amount of dynamic scoring fairy dust will fix the catastrophic deficits of the GOP tax scam.” McCain, a key player in July’s collapse of a Republican effort to gut Obamacare, backed the tax bill. While “far from perfect,” the party’s 2008 presidential nominee said it would boost the economy and help all Americans. Republican Senator Susan Collins, who also played a role in the failure of the Obamacare rollback, told reporters she was still not committed to the bill. Several Republicans were withholding support while pushing for including a federal deduction for up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes and bigger tax breaks for “pass-through” companies, including small businesses. As drafted, the Senate bill would cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent after a one-year delay and reduce the tax burden on businesses and individuals, while ending many tax breaks, but would still expand the deficit, Trump wants to enact tax cuts before January. The House approved its own tax bill on Nov. 16. It would have to be merged with the Senate bill, if it is approved, before any final measure could go to Trump for his signature.  Republicans have 52 votes in the 100-member Senate, giving them enough to win if they hold together. With Democrats opposed, Republicans could lose no more than two of their own votes, with Vice President Mike Pence able to break a 50-50 tie. Trump has attacked Corker and Flake on Twitter. Both senators are not seeking re-election. In early October, the president called Corker, “Liddle’ Bob Corker” in a tweet. Corker tweeted that the Trump White House was an “adult daycare center.” Days later, he called Trump a liar who had damaged U.S. standing in the world. Trump tweeted back saying Corker “couldn’t get elected dog catcher.” Trump earlier this month tweeted that Flake’s political career was ‘toast’” In a dramatic Senate speech, Flake said U.S. politics had become inured to “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior from the White House.

"(Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Friday he was “committed to establishing a working relationship” and fostering “open dialogue” with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, after the two met in Washington.  Rossello, who took office on Jan. 2, met with Mnuchin to discuss his efforts to “put Puerto Rico’s financial house in order,” a statement from the governor’s office said. Rossello has signed more than 20 bills and executive orders aimed at cutting spending and fostering economic growth, but Puerto Rico faces a long haul out of an economic crisis characterized by a 45 percent poverty rate, near-insolvent public pensions and healthcare systems, and almost $70 billion in debt.  Under former President Barack Obama, the Treasury took a hands-on approach in Puerto Rico, working with federal lawmakers on legislation aimed at giving the U.S. territory a way to cut debt. President Donald Trump has given little indication of how his administration may handle Puerto Rico.  The island’s finances are under the supervision of a federally appointed board. Rossello on Tuesday is scheduled to present the board with a 10-year blueprint for the island’s fiscal turnaround.  The board has said the plan should find $4.5 billion a year in savings and revenue, including a 10 percent reduction in pension benefits and $1 billion in annual savings on healthcare spending. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Rossello said his plan will generally meet the board’s criteria, with some exceptions, particularly on healthcare spending. “A $1 billion reduction in healthcare would not only severely hamper the people of Puerto Rico, it would also cripple what is a healthy industry, the healthcare industry,” Rossello said. Puerto Rico’s Medicare system is on the brink of insolvency, in part because, as a U.S. territory, it receives proportionately less federal reimbursement than states. Rossello has said he will lobby the federal government to increase such funding, but the board has said the turnaround plan should not assume any funding changes or help from Washington.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will need a new economic strategy geared toward Asia should the new U.S. administration start a trade war with China, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Friday, warning against protectionism hours after President Donald Trump was sworn in. “I think we have to prepare for a rough ride,” Gabriel said in an interview with the public broadcaster ZDF, in the first official German reaction to Trump’s inauguration. He added that Trump’s election was the result of “a bad radicalization”. The leader of the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD), coalition partners of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling conservatives, dismissed suggestions that Trump may not pursue some controversial promises, such as imposing high tariffs on cars imported from Mexico. “He means it extremely seriously,” said Gabriel. “What we heard today were high nationalistic tones.” He added that all that was missing from Trump’s speech was comparing parliament to a “Quasselbude” or “talking shop,” a term used by Hitler before he took power to discredit the parliamentary democracy of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s. Gabriel said the European Union and Germany must stand together “to defend our interests” and to prevent such nationalistic fervor from gripping the continent. Germany will hold a general election in September in which the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is expected to enter the national parliament for the first time. Trump has criticized Merkel’s decision in 2015 to throw open Germany’s borders to asylum seekers fleeing wars and conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere and has said he believes other countries will leave the EU after Britain. Merkel, who had a close relationship with former U.S. president Barack Obama, responded to his comments in a newspaper interview earlier this month by saying that Europe’s destiny was in its own hands. German government sources told Reuters this week that Merkel was working to set a date this spring for a meeting with Trump.  The United States is Germany’s biggest trading partner and Trump has warned that his administration will impose a border tax of 35 percent on cars that German carmaker BMW plans to build at a new plant in Mexico and export to the U.S. There are fears that a protectionist trade policy by Trump could harm the global economy. A trade war with China would be particularly harmful for Germany, a leading exporting nation that gets nearly half its gross domestic product from exports. “Should the United States start a trade war with China and all of Asia then we as Europeans and Germans are fair partners,” Gabriel said. “Europe and Germany need a strategy geared toward Asia and China and we have new opportunities.” He added: “We should neither be submissive nor have fear.” ",politicsNews,0

"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - More than 2,600 houses have been burned down in Rohingya-majority areas of Myanmar s northwest in the last week, the government said on Saturday, in one of the deadliest bouts of violence involving the Muslim minority in decades. About 58,600 Rohingya have fled into neighbouring Bangladesh from Myanmar, according to U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, as aid workers there struggle to cope. Myanmar officials blamed the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) for the burning of the homes. The group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on security posts last week that prompted clashes and a large army counter-offensive.  But Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh say a campaign of arson and killings by the Myanmar army is aimed at trying to force them out. The treatment of Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the Muslim minority that has long complained of persecution. Former colonial power Britain said on Saturday it hoped Suu Kyi would use her  remarkable qualities  to end the violence.  Aung San Suu Kyi is rightly regarded as one of the most inspiring figures of our age, but the treatment of the Rohingya is, alas, besmirching the reputation of Burma,  foreign minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. The clashes and army crackdown have killed nearly 400 people and more than 11,700  ethnic residents  have been evacuated from the area, the government said, referring to the non-Muslim residents. It marks a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since October, when a smaller Rohingya attack on security posts prompted a military response dogged by allegations of rights abuses.  A total of 2,625 houses from Kotankauk, Myinlut and Kyikanpyin villages and two wards in Maungtaw were burned down by the ARSA extremist terrorists,  the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government.  But Human Rights Watch, which analysed satellite imagery and accounts from Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, said the Myanmar security forces deliberately set the fires. New satellite imagery shows the total destruction of a Muslim village, and prompts serious concerns that the level of devastation in northern Rakhine state may be far worse than originally thought,  said the group s deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson. Near the Naf river separating Myanmar and Bangladesh, new arrivals in Bangladesh carrying their belongings in sacks set up crude tents or tried to squeeze into available shelters or homes of locals.   The existing camps are near full capacity and numbers are swelling fast. In the coming days there needs to be more space,  said UNHCR regional spokeswoman Vivian Tan, adding more refugees were expected.  The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. Bangladesh is also growing increasingly hostile to Rohingya, more than 400,000 of whom live in the poor South Asian country after fleeing Myanmar since the early 1990s. Jalal Ahmed, 60, who arrived in Bangladesh on Friday with a group of about 3,000 after walking from Kyikanpyin for almost a week, said he believed the Rohingya were being pushed out of Myanmar.   The military came with 200 people to the village and started fires...All the houses in my village are already destroyed. If we go back there and the army sees us, they will shoot,  he said.  Reuters could not independently verify these accounts as access for independent journalists to northern Rakhine has been restricted since security forces locked down the area in October. Speaking to soldiers, government staff and Rakhine Buddhists affected by the conflict on Friday, army chief Min Aung Hlaing said there is no  oppression or intimidation  against the Muslim minority and  everything is within the framework of the law .  The Bengali problem was a long-standing one which has become an unfinished job,  he said, using a term used by many in Myanmar to refer to the Rohingya that suggests they come from Bangladesh.  Many aid programmes running in northern Rakhine prior to the outbreak of violence, including life-saving food assistance by the World Food Programme (WFP), have been suspended since the fighting broke out.  Food security indicators and child malnutrition rates in Maungdaw were already above emergency thresholds before the violence broke out, and it is likely that they will now deteriorate even further,  said Pierre Peron, spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Myanmar. More than 80,000 children may need treatment for malnutrition in northern Rakhine and many of them reported  extreme  food insecurity, WFP said in July. In Bangladesh, Tan of UNHCR said more shelters and medical care were needed.  There s a lot of pregnant women and lactating mothers and really young children, some of them born during the flight. They all need medical attention,  she said. Among new arrivals, 22-year-old Tahara Begum gave birth to her second child in a forest on the way to Bangladesh.   It was the hardest thing I ve ever done,  she said.  ",worldnews,0
"JUCHITAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Destruction wrought by Mexico s massive earthquake has put a spotlight on the quasi-matriarchal indigenous traditions of the worst affected town, with women and third-gender  muxes  playing a leading role in the aftermath of the disaster.  Located in Mexico s narrow isthmus region, about 400 miles (644 km) southeast of capital Mexico City, Juchitan bore the brunt of the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that flattened thousands of buildings in the humid market town in a matter of seconds and took at least 98 lives nationwide. In vivid contrast to Mexico s macho, male-dominated society, travelers have noted since at least the 1800s the relative equality of Juchitan s mainly Zapotec men and women, as well as the prominence of muxes, Zapotecs born biologically male who mix gay and feminine identity. After the earth shook violently just before midnight on Thursday, women, muxes and men all leapt into action, in many cases pulling away rubble with their bare hands.  I carried my mother out as I left the house, and then my brother and I went to rescue my aunt who was trapped,  Peregrina Vera, a tall, 26-year-old muxe, said in a sing-song voice, her long hair tied in a bun.  She then helped pull up rubble to free her grandmother after hearing shouts for help, Vera said, sitting in an outdoor patio just beyond the collapsed walls of her house, where two aggressive pet ducks snapped brightly colored bills at visitors. Locals say there is a muxe in every Juchitan family. They are widely accepted despite an ingrained Roman Catholic heritage and known for dedication to family, especially for taking care of mothers as other siblings move out. Among the severely damaged buildings was the downtown market, the most important for miles around and the heart of Zapotec women s economic power for more than a century. Slated for demolition due to the quake damage, its loss is a blow to Juchitan s women. Irma Lopez, 44, who sold traditional indigenous clothing, was proud that 80 percent of market vendors were women but said it meant they were particularly hard hit by the destruction.   We are the ones who have lost the most,  Lopez said, standing just outside the market as a light rain fell. She was waiting for relatives to help remove her last boxes of merchandise, as trucks pulled up to haul away her and other women s goods. In an 1859 account, French traveler and historian Brasseur de Bourbourg appreciatively described the sprawling marketplace as run by strong, unrestrained women who  openly made fun of their men ... with a shamelessness hardly equaled.  Roughly eight in 10 residents of Juchitan are indigenous, mostly Zapotec. Women are typically also in charge of family finances, said Felina Santiago, a muxe and beauty shop owner, speaking outside her badly damaged home.   Many say Juchitan is the ultimate matriarchy. It s a city of women who fight, who work hard,  Santiago said.  Now more than ever, we re going to work to get back on our feet,  she said, just as a structure on her block loudly collapsed, causing a sudden stir as neighbors rushed to the spot. No one was hurt. In Juchitan s Seventh Division residential neighborhood, Margarita Lopez, a 56-year-old domestic worker, craned her head as she stood in a crowd of women waiting for a promised delivery of government aid, which turned out to be mostly canned food.  Yes, we have our husbands, and we don t leave them behind. But we women matter more. We take decisions, more than the men do,  she said, as others nearby nodded in agreement. Lopez spoke of how it is common in the city of about 100,000 people for husbands to help with household chores like cooking and washing dishes, in a country where such tasks are traditionally seen as the preserve of women. Men find the division of labor in the area  natural,  said male Juchitan surgeon Ovidio Pineda. Women and men  share the decisions, share the responsibilities,  he added. Martha Toledo, whose bar housed in a 200-year-old building collapsed in the quake, killing three clients, said the disaster would not crush Juchitan s spirit, as another aftershock sent her and others running to safety.      Women stand out here, in terms of work and intelligence and experience,  she said, wearing a traditional huipil top and standing near the pile of rubble that was once the bar.  We have to rebuild and rise like the phoenix,  she said, breaking out into a song in the Zapotec language with the chorus  I want to shout, I am alive!  ",worldnews,0
"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Votes cast for New Zealand s ruling National Party hit 46.5 percent on Saturday evening with 70 percent of results counted, putting the center-right party in the lead as it vies for a fourth term in government, according to the Electoral Commission.  Center-left Labour accounted for 35.5 percent and its possible coalition partner, the Green Party had 5.9 percent of the vote.  Still, the National Party would likely need the populist New Zealand First Party, which had 7.4 percent of the vote, to form a government. A complete preliminary count was expected by around 2330 local time, but the final result, which would also include ballots cast by New Zealanders overseas, would not be released until Oct. 7.

"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea s nuclear threat looms large this week over the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York, where diplomats are eager to hear U.S. President Donald Trump address the 193-member body for the first time.  North Korean diplomats will have a front-row seat in the U.N. General Assembly for Trump s speech on Tuesday morning, which will touch on the escalating crisis that has seen Trump and Pyongyang trade threats of military action.  Despite his skepticism about the value of international organizations and the United Nations in particular, Trump will seek support for tough measures against North Korea, while pressing his  America First  message to the world body.  This is not an issue between the United States and North Korea. This is an issue between the world and North Korea,  Trump s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said on Friday. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres - who, like Trump, took office in January - plans to meet separately with  concerned parties,  including North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, on the sidelines of the 72nd General Assembly.  The solution can only be political. Military action could cause devastation on a scale that would take generations to overcome,  Guterres warned on Wednesday.  A week ago, the 15-member U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted its ninth sanctions resolution since 2006 over North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said U.N. sanctions had banned 90 percent of the Asian state s publicly reported exports, saying of Pyongyang on Friday:  This is totally in their hands on how they respond.  Haley told CNN s  State of the Union  program on Sunday that Washington had  pretty much exhausted  its options on North Korea at the Security Council. Ri is due to address the General Assembly on Friday. Some leaders will also push Trump not to give up on a 2015 deal curbing Iran s nuclear ambitions in return for a lifting of U.N., U.S. and European sanctions, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was time to  fix it - or cancel it.  The foreign ministers of Iran, the United States, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and France - the parties to the agreement - are due to meet on Wednesday ahead of an October deadline for Trump to tell Congress if he believes Tehran is sticking to what he has described as  the worst deal ever negotiated.  When asked on Friday what Moscow s message would be for Washington, Russia s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said:  Stay in the JCPOA (the nuclear deal).  A senior U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:  We are faced with real uncertainties with respect to North Korea and it s a bit dangerous ... to add another source of uncertainty with respect to Iran.  Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday his country would not be bullied by the United States and would react strongly to any  wrong move  by Washington on the nuclear deal.  Iran and North Korea will also feature heavily during a ministerial Security Council meeting on Thursday, at the request of the United States, to discuss the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  While leaders and diplomats are also due to meet on longer-running crises including Libya, Syria, South Sudan, Mali, Central African Republic, Yemen and Iraq, a last-minute addition has been Myanmar, where the United Nations has branded violence against Rohingya Muslims as  ethnic cleansing.   Britain is due to host a ministerial meeting on Monday to seek a way to get Myanmar authorities to end a military offensive in the country s Rakhine state that has sent more than 400,000 minority Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh. Following Trump s announcement that the United States would withdraw from a landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, several high-level gatherings are planned on the sidelines of the General Assembly to bolster the deal.  Climate change is a serious threat,  Guterres told reporters.  Hurricanes and floods around the world remind us that extreme weather events are expected to become more frequent and severe, due to climate change.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to hold the door open for the United States to remain in the Paris climate accord  under the right conditions.   The president said he is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue,  Tillerson said on CBS   Face The Nation  program on Sunday.  Trump will seek to boost support for reforming the United Nations, which he once called  a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.  The United States is the largest U.N. contributor and Trump has complained that Washington pays too much.  The United Nations, of course, holds tremendous potential to realize its founding ideals, but only if it s run more efficiently and effectively,  McMaster said on Friday.     ",worldnews,0

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU diplomats will start sketching out a Brexit transition offer on Wednesday that would probably let Britain stay in the single market for about two years after it leaves the bloc in March 2019, EU officials said. But some officials and diplomats involved in preparing for the first  orientation debate  among envoys from the other 27 EU states warned London should not assume it can clinch an initial deal next month to open talks on post-Brexit relations. Some governments see benefits in making Britain wait for it. A paper prepared for the discussion, seen by Reuters, showed the envoys would discuss the  scope  and  duration  of a transition, including how far Britain could remain in the single market - with all its obligations - and in other EU programs such as agriculture and fisheries schemes, the nuclear pact Euratom and security and defense arrangements. They would also debate how the transition would affect EU agreements with other states, such as trade, fisheries and aviation treaties. Several officials who spoke to Reuters said Britain would have to abide by all EU laws in the transition period, even if they are changed during that period, but would have no influence over them.   Anything else would be too complicated,  a second official said. Two others expressed the same view.      The EU view on the transition period and the future will in a way be a moment of truth, exposing all the lies of those who campaigned for Brexit saying that Britain will be able to have the cake and eat it,  a third official said. Wednesday s discussions will also seek to gather views on the trade relationship with London that is to follow a transition, which may finish in December 2020, at the end of the current seven-year EU budget period.  EU leaders told Prime Minister Theresa May last month they were not ready to negotiate post-Brexit arrangements until London offered more concessions on its  divorce  terms. But they held out the prospect of opening such talks at a summit in mid-December and ordered their officials to start preparing among the 27 for a move to this new phase of talks.  British Brexit Minister David Davis is expected in Brussels on Friday for the first negotiations since the mid-October summit with May. But the anticipated brief encounter with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is not expected to produce a breakthrough on how much Britain will pay the EU on leaving. Diplomats and officials said the continued slow pace of the divorce talks was increasing the possibility that EU leaders would again refuse next month to open trade talks. They said some may already be considering that as a useful tactic against Britain, which is anxious to prevent businesses relocating investment.  Some believe that the worse it gets for the British, the better for us... that maybe we could delay it all until for instance March, increasing the uncertainty and triggering the contingency plans in the corporate sector,  the first EU official said.   That would be ruthless and risky, but people have different views on what is risky.  An EU diplomat involved in negotiations said he expected envoys also to discuss how to handle a possible failure next month to open the next phase of talks if May refuses to meet EU demands.  What do we do if they (the British) don t move?  he said. Some continental negotiators believe British anxiety about businesses starting to shift investments in the new year if there is no transition deal could be to Brussels  advantage. Officials said Britain s full membership in the single market, even during a transition, is not a given.  There is no up-front agreement on that. It is part of a bigger package. For instance it is not feasible to expect they would be in the single market ... but not pay into the EU budget,  one said.     There will be one or two more meetings of EU envoys before they expect to agree what they might offer Britain in terms of a transition period, officials said. The results of these discussions will not be presented to the British, however, until leaders have agreed to open a new phase of talks. ",worldnews,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager,  lashed out on Tuesday at reports he was wiretapped by federal authorities, and his spokesman sent out a statement demanding a leaks probe and suggesting the surveillance was politically motivated. The statement issued by spokesman Jason Maloni on behalf of Manafort came a day after CNN reported that a secret court had authorized surveillance of Manafort under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), under which Americans can be targeted if they are suspected of acting as an agent of a foreign country. Manafort became Trump’s campaign manager in June 2016 but was forced to resign two months later amid reports of his business relationship with the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovich. Manafort is being investigated as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The court initially authorized FISA surveillance of Manafort in 2014 but that lapsed in 2016 for lack of evidence, CNN reported. FISA surveillance resumed later in 2016 and continued into 2017 as part of the FBI’s probe into ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian operatives, CNN said. “If true, it is a felony to reveal the existence of a FISA warrant, regardless of the fact that no charges ever emerged,” Maloni said in the statement on behalf of Manafort. “The U.S. Department of Justice’s Inspector General should immediately conduct an investigation into these leaks and to examine the motivations behind a previous administration’s effort to surveil a political opponent,” he said. The special counsel’s office and the FBI both declined to comment on Maloni’s statement. They also did not comment on CNN’s original report about surveillance of Manafort. Maloni urged the Justice Department to release any intercepts between Manafort and any non-Americans so people “can come to the same conclusion as the DOJ (Justice Department) - there is nothing there.” As part of the special counsel’s probe, federal agents with search warrants raided Manafort’s Virginia home in July. The New York Times, citing two people close to the case, reported on Monday that prosecutors later told Manafort they planned to indict him. CNN said interest in Manafort deepened because of intercepted communications between him and Russian operatives, and among the Russians. The government eavesdropping continued into 2017, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to Trump after he became president. CNN said it was unclear if Trump was picked up on the surveillance. ",politicsNews,0

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Jewish groups in Germany are pressing the authorities to crack down on anti-Semitic acts following the burning of Jewish symbols and Israeli flags at protests. The American Jewish Committee Berlin, the JSUD group of Jewish university students, the Central Council of Jews in Germany, and the German-Israeli Society have called for tougher law enforcement and for new laws to make it easier to ban or disband anti-Semitic demonstrations. Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top German officials have  condemned anti-Semitic acts seen at demonstrations against U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and vowed to prosecute illegal acts. The American Jewish Committee Berlin said a new study by an Indiana University professor showed broader efforts were also needed to fight anti-Semitic attitudes among Muslim migrants from Syria and Iraq. German has opened its borders to more than 1 million migrants mainly fleeing Middle East wars since 2015, sparking concerns about a further bump in already increasing anti-Semitism.  Politicians must guarantee that anti-Semitic attitudes will not be tolerated and that infractions to laws and regulations will be prosecuted,  said the group s director, Deidre Berger. She reiterated a longstanding call for the German government to appoint an anti-Semitism commissioner to focus attention on the issue. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas and Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller vowed during a menorah lighting at the Brandenburg Gate on Tuesday to combat all forms of anti-Semitism, while demonstrators continued to voice anger at the U.S. move at a separate event near Berlin s main train station. The Central Council of Muslims in Germany has also condemned anti-Semitic actions. Indiana University s Guenther Jikeli, the author of the study, said group interviews of 68 migrants aged 18 to 52 conducted last year revealed widespread anti-Semitic attitudes. They showed rejection of the state of Israel and ignorance about the murder of 6 million Jews in Europe by the Nazis during World War Two, he said.  There are strong anti-Semitic views among refugees that need to be addressed because otherwise they could become the norm,  he told Reuters TV. Kurds and other refugees persecuted as minorities in their home countries had more nuanced views and more clearly rejected anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli perspectives, he said. Fabian Weissbarth, spokesman for AJC, said the study should spur efforts to tackle anti-Semitism among migrants to ensure the findings were not misused by anti-immigrant far-right groups like the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.  If we don t address it as a society, then the AfD will, and that will lead to hate and incitement,  he said.  We need a differentiated view that recognizes that not all refugees are the same, and we need to look at solutions, such as integration measures, what needs to be included in integration courses, and changes in how social workers and politicians react.

"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Swedish journalist Kim Wall died when she was accidentally hit by a heavy hatch cover on board a home-made submarine, the Danish owner of the vessel testified in court on Tuesday. Peter Madsen, who denies killing Wall, said he was holding the hatch for her but it slipped and hit her head as they sailed in the strait between Denmark and Sweden last month on the UC3 Nautilus submarine he had built.  Madsen, 46, was speaking in court after being charged with killing the Swedish journalist on the submarine and mutilating her body   a case bearing many of the attributes of the region s popular Nordic Noir books and films. It could mean a sentence of five years to life in prison for Madsen, if found guilty. The court on Tuesday ordered a psychiatric evaluation and that Madsen be kept in custody for four weeks. In its preliminary investigation, the court had ordered Madsen detained until Tuesday on the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. Madsen said Wall s death was an accident. With the vessel at the surface, he said he had crawled out through the hatch and was standing on top, while holding it open  to let Wall follow him. At that moment, the submarine was rocked by a wave from another boat.  I lose my foothold and the hatch shuts,  he told the Copenhagen court, saying Wall was knocked to the floor.  There was a pool of blood where she had landed.  A prosecutor also read earlier testimony from behind closed doors in which Madsen said the impact had fractured the journalist s skull and killed her. Madsen said he tried to bury her at sea but denied mutilating her body, and added that he had contemplated killing himself while still on board. Wall, a 30-year-old freelance journalist who was researching a story on Madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in his 17-metre (56-foot) submarine on Aug. 10. On Aug. 23, police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall s. The cause of her death has not been determined. In court, Madsen denied having amputated her limbs and said he dropped her  whole  body into the water, several hours after her death, after having a sleep because he was  tired and exhausted . He admitted that he wanted to  bury her at sea  by attaching metal to the body in order for it to sink.   I had no contact with the body and didn t want a dead body in my submarine,  Madsen told the court.  I put a rope around her feet to drag her out of the hatch,  he said, adding that he was crying during this operation.  I am suicidal at this stage (and) thought a fitting end for Peter Madsen would be on board the Nautilus,  he said.  I was in a condition where I decided I couldn t continue the life I had been living.  He changed his mind, he said, because he wanted to see his wife and three cats. The submarine is one of three Madsen had built and one of the largest privately built ones in the world. It could carry eight people and weighed 40 tonnes fully equipped. A day after taking Wall out to sea, Madsen was rescued in a navy operation after deliberately sinking the vessel. ",worldnews,0
"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron s government announced reforms to loosen labor regulations and drive down unemployment, drawing criticism from unions but limited support for the street protests that have hindered previous reform bids.  After weeks of negotiations with unions over the summer, the centrist government revealed measures including a cap on payouts for dismissals adjudged unfair and greater freedom to hire and fire. The plan would also give companies more flexibility to adapt pay and working hours to market conditions. The labor code reform is the first big test of Macron s drive to re-shape the euro zone s second biggest economy with its near double-digit jobless rate, double that in Britain and markedly higher than Germany. He also seeks a  grand bargain  with Germany over broader reforms of the euro zone. For decades, governments of the left and right have tried to reform France s strict labor rules, but have always diluted them in the face of street protests. The reform makes no direct reference to France s 35-hour week but gives employers more flexibility to negotiate deals with employees to work around it. Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud described the five decrees laying out the reforms as  a transformation of labor rules on an unprecedented scale . Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said they were necessary to fight France s stubbornly high unemployment.   The truth is that for bosses, especially of small companies, and foreign investors, the existing labor law is seen as a brake on hiring and investment,  Philippe said. Trade unions were less upbeat at what they perceived as the loss of long-cherished workers  rights.  All of our fears have been confirmed,  said Philippe Martinez, head of the hard-left CGT union, after the government presented the decrees to unions and employers. He said the union would press ahead with its plan for a protest on Sept. 12. But Macron s assiduous courting of the unions over the summer appeared to have born fruit. France s biggest union, the reformist CFDT, said it was disappointed with what amounted to a missed opportunity to improve labor relations. But both the CFDT and the smaller Force Ouvriere, one of the spearheads of last year s anti-reform protests, said they would not be joining the CGT s protest.   This reform does not rise to the occasion , CFDT leader Laurent Berger told reporters, but he added:  Taking to the streets is not the only mode of action for unions.  It sets a cap on compensation for a dismissal judged in a labor court to be unfair. This will be set at three months of wages for two years in the company with the amount rising progressively depending on how long a worker was with the firm. In a concession to unions, normal severance pay would be increased from 20 percent of one month s wage for each year in a company to 25 percent. Economists drew parallels with Germany and Spain.  This very much resembles the labor reform carried out in Germany in 2004-2005,  said Florian Hense, European economist at Berenberg Bank.  This could very well propel France to a golden decade like Germany had.   Dutch bank ING said:  The ceiling on dismissal compensation is a milestone in labor flexibility and a real positive for permanent contract creation. In Spain, a similar reform kick-started an unprecedented labor market recovery.   Pierre Gattaz, the head of the MEDEF employers federation, described the reforms as an important first step which would boost confidence within companies. The CPME, a small business lobby, was even more positive.  At last!,  it said in a statement.  After months of negotiations, we got results. The reform we had been waiting for so long is there.  The labor reforms comes as the 39-year-old president suffers a steep drop in popularity ratings. Early policy announcements including an overhaul of the wealth tax and cuts to housing assistance have left a swathe of voters feeling his policies favor the rich, pollsters say. The government plans to start talks on overhauling unemployment benefits in October before tackling pension reform next year.  Parliament, where Macron s Republic on the Move party has a commanding majority, has already voted to allow the government to issue the decrees without a vote in the assembly. The government plans to adopt the decrees on Sept. 22.    ",worldnews,0
"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Sunday: Trump ramps up his criticism of a federal judge who blocked a travel ban on seven mainly Muslim nations and says courts were making U.S. border security harder, intensifying the first major legal battle of his presidency. Many of those caught up in Trump’s travel ban last weekend took advantage of a federal judge’s order temporarily suspending the order to complete their disrupted journeys to the United States. Trump faces an uphill battle to overcome a federal judge’s temporary hold on his travel ban, but the outcome of a ruling on the executive order’s ultimate legality is less certain, experts say Several technology companies plan to send a letter Trump on Monday urging his administration to follow through on proposed changes to the travel ban, sources familiar with the letter say. Washington state’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s executive order on immigration emerged out of a chaotic, 48-hour period in which the need for immediate action held sway over the kind of carefully thought-out strategizing that usually leads up to the filing of a major legal complaint, according to state Attorney General Bob Ferguson and other attorneys involved in actions against the order. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel says he was reassured after meetings last week with top U.S. officials that the United States is committed to a united Europe and to the NATO alliance. Despite declarations of unity at a recent European Union summit in Malta, EU countries are split on how to respond to policies from Trump, who has reversed staunch postwar U.S. support for European integration and suggested others follow Britain out of a bloc he has called “a vehicle for Germany.” Trump’s first two weeks in office have left some European politicians leaders aghast but are drawing cheers from France’s far-right National Front, as its leader, Marine Le Pen, launches her own bid for power. The governor of Colorado says he believes the Cuban government wants to further improve relations with the United States under Trump, as he wraps up a three-day visit to the Communist-run island nation. Trump says in remarks broadcast on Sunday that he would put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of a commission to probe what he believes was voter fraud in last November’s election. ",politicsNews,0
"(Reuters) - Energy infrastructure companies in the Caribbean and southeastern United States continued to restart as of Friday after shutdowns due to Hurricane Irma. Irma was downgraded to a tropical depression on Monday and weakened further into a post-tropical cyclone by Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said.  Kinder Morgan Inc said it is making  significant progress  on restarting systems that were temporarily or partially shut down as a precaution during the passage of Irma. It said the Orlando and Tampa products terminals and their associated truck racks, the Central Florida Pipeline (CFPL), Elba Island LNG Terminal, the Plantation Pipe Line system, and other terminals in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina are fully operational. Dominican Republican Refidomsa s Haina refinery and its docks returned to normal after Irma, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Statoil  said operations at South Riding Point resumed earlier this week after being shut down during the weekend.  Buckeye Partners LP did not immediately have an update available on its Bahamas crude oil and fuel terminal, previously known as Borco. The terminal is Buckeye s largest and can store about 26.2 million barrels of oil, fuel oil, gasoline and other products. Buckeye s terminals in Puerto Rico have returned to normal, a spokesman told Reuters in an email. Port Everglades, South Florida s main petroleum delivery hub, said it is open with no restrictions. Of the 12 petroleum terminals supplying transportation fuels, 10 were up and delivering fuel to retail stations and two that are still working to reopen have water intrusion and related issues, the Port said. Irma, which had ranked as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record before striking the U.S. mainland as a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday, has been blamed for at least 82 deaths, with several hard-hit Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, accounting for more than half the fatalities.

"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s executive order directing federal agencies to take away funding from self-proclaimed sanctuary cities had one big exemption for one of his favorite constituencies: the police, who would be protected from cuts. But Trump’s opponents say that very exemption makes it much more likely that a judge could strike down that section of the order as unconstitutional. It is just one example of the legal arguments that cities, immigration groups and other opponents are readying as they prepare to fight an executive order signed by Trump on Wednesday that would cut federal aid to “sanctuary” jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Lawyers for the potential challengers pointed to court rulings that said the federal government can only withhold funds to local jurisdictions if the money is directly tied to the behavior it objects to. The Trump administration cannot cut funds for sanctuary cities’ healthcare and education while preserving money for police, since those jobs relate more closely to immigration enforcement, said Richard Doyle, city attorney in San Jose, California. He said it was not clear whether existing federal funding or only future grants would be targeted.    Supporters of the new Republican president’s actions say that sanctuary cities ignore federal law and think the White House will be able to answer with a strong case in court. Federal law allows Trump to restrict public assistance “of any kind where an illegal alien could possibly benefit,” said Dale Wilcox, executive director of the Washington-based conservative Immigration Reform Law Institute.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio in a news conference said his chief legal officer would be in court the “hour” after any specific action to withhold money came through. “There is less here than meets the eye. This executive order is written in a very vague fashion,” said de Blasio, a Democrat. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera, also a Democrat, said his office was still examining whether it could sue before Trump made any specific move to cut funds.  Trump’s order directed that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with immigration authorities.  Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said the cities can argue “they are fully in compliance with that statute,” since they do share information with federal authorities, but offer limited cooperation when it comes to turning over immigrants who are not convicted criminals. There could also be procedural snarls to implementing the cuts, lawyers who specialize in federal grants said. If the U.S. government seeks to cut off grants to a certain recipient, it must go through a complicated process known as “suspension and debarment,” and cities would have the right to appeal. “It’s fair to say that they don’t understand the scope and reach of federal grants law,” said Edward Waters, who heads the federal grants practice at the law firm Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell in Washington, referring to the Trump administration. The White House would also have to negotiate with states that are home to sanctuary cities. Nearly 90 percent of $652 billion the federal government handed out through more 1,500 separate grant programs in the most recent fiscal year went to states, not directly to cities, according to a Reuters review of federal spending data. If the Trump administration wanted to try to cut off Medicaid money to Chicago, for example, it would have to work through the state government of Illinois, which could pose an additional barrier, Waters said. Advocacy groups for immigrants’ rights said they are also preparing their own legal challenges to other aspects of two executive orders Trump signed on Wednesday, examining sections that deal with expanding detention of immigrants and changing how asylum requests are processed.  “All of our legal research is done, most of the complaints are all drafted,” said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, based in Los Angeles. She said litigation could be filed in the next days. ",politicsNews,0
"(Reuters) - Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin plans to call a special legislative session to fill a budget shortfall of $215 million tied to cigarette sales, according to a statement issued by her office on Wednesday.  “I am planning on calling a special session beginning September 25 for legislators to adjust the current fiscal year budget,” she said in a statement.  On Aug. 10, Oklahoma’s State Supreme Court ruled against a measure passed during the last legislative session that created a $1.50 “cessation” fee for cigarette packs. The fee was expected to add about $215 million to state coffers, mostly earmarked for health and human services agencies.  Fallin said in a statement last month that the ruling meant Oklahoma would also miss out on federal matching funds. The fee was passed when lawmakers were attempting to fill an $878 million budget shortfall.  A special session would cost Oklahoma an additional $30,000 per day, according to an August statement by the state’s House Democratic Caucus.  Following Fallin’s announcement Wednesday, House Speaker Charles McCall, in a statement, said House Republicans would consider raising a cigarette tax in a special session “but will send it to a vote of the people if House Democrats again refuse to support the measure.” If passed in special session, the cigarette tax would generate approximately $122 million for fiscal 2018’s budget, the statement said. The balance of money to plug the hole would come from existing budget sources as well as utilizing some of the state’s Rainy Day Fund “The cigarette tax is the only feasible tax option Oklahomans have said they would support,” McCall said. Oklahoma’s fiscal issues stem from tax cuts and structural changes to the state budget, further exacerbated by a decline in energy prices a few years ago, said Robert Dauffenbach, a senior associate dean for economic development and impact at the University of Oklahoma. Oklahoma has a balanced budget requirement. Its fiscal 2018 budget totaled about $6.8 billion, according to Michael McNutt, a spokesman for Fallin. The yield on Oklahoma 10-year general obligation bonds traded 20 basis points over the benchmark Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data AAA yield scale at the close on Tuesday. The yield was little changed from the end of May, when the state’s legislative session ended.  ",politicsNews,0
"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims fleeing a Myanmar military offensive arrived in Bangladesh on Monday with fresh accounts of violence and arson  as a rights group called for sanctions and an arms embargo to stop what the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. The latest wave of violence in western Myanmar s Rakhine State began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp, killing about 12 people. The Myanmar military response has sent more than 410,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, escaping what they and rights monitors say is a campaign aimed at driving out the Muslim population. Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects that, saying its forces are carrying out clearance operations against the insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which claimed responsibility for the August attacks and smaller raids in October. Hundreds of refugees traveled by small boats to an island on the southernmost point of Bangladesh late on Sunday and on Monday, telling of persecution and destruction.  The army came and they burned our homes, they killed our people. There was a mob of Rakhine people too,  said Usman Goni, 55, after he stepped off a boat with his seven children and wife, clutching two sticks tied in rope and a sack. Many of the refugees have spoken of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist civilians joining the Myanmar army in its attacks. Myanmar denies that and has blamed Muslim insurgents for the violence. Myanmar has largely sealed the area off to aid workers and reporters. Rights groups say satellite images show about 80 smouldering Muslim villages. They have seen evidence of arson attacks on Buddhist villagers, but on a much smaller scale. Most of the new arrivals said their villages had been torched on Friday, when huge clouds of smoke were clearly seen over Myanmar.  There s nothing left,  said a Nurhaba, 23, who said she was from a village close to Maungdaw town. About a million Rohingya lived in Rakhine State until the recent violence. Most face draconian travel restrictions and are denied citizenship in a country where many Buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar government leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced a barrage of criticism from abroad for not stopping the violence. The military remains in charge of security and there is little sympathy for the Rohingya in a country where the end of army rule has unleashed old animosities. The military campaign in Rakhine State has wide support. Suu Kyi is due to speak to the nation on Tuesday about a crisis the United States has called a  defining moment  for her country. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy is due in Myanmar this week.  He will travel to Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, to meet government officials and representatives of different communities, including Rohingya, but he is not seeking to travel to the conflict zone in northern Rakhine State. Human Rights Watch said Myanmar security forces were disregarding world condemnation and the time had come to impose tougher measures that the generals could not ignore. It called for governments to  impose travel bans and asset freezes on security officials implicated in serious abuses; expand existing arms embargoes to include all military sales, assistance, and cooperation; and place a ban on financial transactions with key ... military-owned enterprises . For years, the United States and Western allies imposed sanctions on Myanmar in support of Suu Kyi s campaign for democracy. Its response was to forge closer ties with China. U.S.-Myanmar ties have been improving since the military began withdrawing from government in 2011, and paved the way for a 2015 election won by Suu Kyi s party. A Trump administration official said the violence made it harder to build warmer ties, and there would likely be some  easing  in the short term, but he did not expect a return to sanctions.  People are too invested in the last five years of thawing, which is understood by everyone to be strategically sound,  said the official, who declined to be identified.  Long-term, the trajectory is probably tighter relations.  In a rare expression of support for the Rohingya from within Myanmar, a group from the Karen ethnic minority, called for the military to halt its operations and for economic sanctions to be considered. For decades of army battled autonomy-seeking Karen insurgents that sent more than 100,000 villagers fleeing to Thailand. The insurgents have now made peace. Bangladesh is struggling to cope with the refugees  and aid workers fear people could die due to a lack of food, shelter and water, given the numbers. Bangladesh has said all refugees must go home. Myanmar has said it will take back those who can verify their citizenship. Several thousand protesters tried to march on the Myanmar embassy in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, but police kept them well back.

"TOLEDO, Ohio; WINSTON SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump criticized Democrat Hillary Clinton on Thursday over her trade policies, saying she would handle trade deals so badly that the country should “just cancel the election” and name him the victor.  Speaking to supporters in Toledo, Ohio, Trump said the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, had led to the outsourcing of thousands of Ohio jobs to Mexico, a practice he vowed to stop if elected president on Nov. 8. “We should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right?” he said. “What are we even having it for? Her policies are so bad.” Trump said he believed Clinton would seek passage of the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership, President Barack Obama’s signature Asian trade deal, which she now opposes. Trump’s remarks came as the New York businessman tries to steady rocky poll numbers amid a series of controversies and self-inflicted wounds.  He has struggled to handle the fallout from the release of a 2005 “Access Hollywood” video that showed the then-reality TV star talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania. Trump said on Thursday it was “certainly illegal” for NBC to release the tape and he left open the option of seeking legal action against the network after the election. Since the video’s release, a series of women have accused Trump of groping them or kissing them without their consent. Trump has called the allegations “absolutely false.” The latest RealClearPolitics poll average showed Clinton with a nearly 6-point national lead over Trump, fueled by declining support among women for his candidacy. Trump, without evidence, has blamed his sagging poll numbers on a rigged election, and said the media had fixed the opinion polls in order to inflate Clinton’s numbers. Numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is very rare, and a number of prominent Republicans have denounced Trump’s claim that the system is unsound. While Trump campaigned in  Ohio, a plane carrying his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, skidded off the runway after landing at New York City’s LaGuardia Airport on Thursday night. There were no injuries, the Pence campaign said. Clinton on Thursday made her first joint campaign appearance with one of her most powerful supporters, first lady Michelle Obama, at a North Carolina rally to urge young people and women to vote. Clinton, a former first lady who lost the 2008 Democratic nomination to then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama before becoming his secretary of state, praised Michelle Obama for standing up for the rights of girls and women worldwide, drawing a sharp contrast with her Republican rival. “I wish I didn’t have to say this. ... But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election,” Clinton told a crowd of about 11,000. “And I want to thank our first lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value.” Michelle Obama’s stinging denunciation of Trump after a leaked 2005 video showed him making lewd remarks and bragging about groping women was seen by many as one of the campaign’s most striking condemnations of the New York businessman. Without naming Trump, Obama took him to task again in North Carolina, asking the crowd which candidate they wanted to represent their daughters from the White House. “We want a president who takes this job seriously, and has the temperament and maturity to do it well. Someone who is steady. Someone who we can trust with the nuclear codes,” Obama said.  “I would not be here lying to you: I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president,” she said. Although Michelle Obama was critical of Clinton during the hard-fought 2008 Democratic nominating race, any trace of bitterness appeared long behind them. The two women showed an easy rapport. They embraced and smiled. Obama called Clinton “my girl” and made a point of telling the crowd they were tight. “If people wonder: Yes, Hillary Clinton is my friend,” she said. Clinton promised to take good care of Obama’s White House vegetable garden if she won and wistfully praised the athletic first lady’s dancing skills. “One could only hope,” Clinton said. She also lauded Obama’s work for children and military families and in what was perhaps a nod to African-Americans she hopes will vote for her in the state, said Obama had faced challenges she had not as a presidential spouse. “Let’s be real. As our first African-American first lady, she’s faced pressures I never did, and she’s handled them with pure grace,” Clinton said to applause. Although a sometimes reluctant campaigner, the first lady has thrown herself into the race, and the Clinton campaign has deployed her strategically to increase support among young people and blacks, with whom she is especially popular.

"YANGON (Reuters) - Proposed U.S. sanctions targeting Myanmar s military for its treatment of Rohingya Muslims would hinder the fledgling civilian government sharing power with the generals, a spokesman for de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Friday. The bill, introduced by members of the U.S. Senate on the eve of Donald Trump s departure on his first trip to Asia since becoming president in January, seeks to reimpose some sanctions lifted last year as Myanmar returned to democracy. The measure would impose targeted sanctions and travel curbs on Myanmar military officials and bar the United States from supplying most assistance to the military until perpetrators of atrocities against the Rohingya in Myanmar s western Rakhine State are held accountable. Responding to the moves in Washington, Suu Kyi s spokesman, Zaw Htay, told Reuters,  we need internal stability to improve the country s economy. Imposing international sanctions directly affects the people in travel and in business investments, and there are many bad consequences.  Myanmar officials would explain the government s efforts on Rakhine during a visit by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson scheduled for Nov. 15, he added.  We will explain to him what we are doing when he comes here. We can not tell him not to do that. And we don t know what is U.S. policy,  Zaw Htay said. Zaw Htay, a former army major who is a holdover from the quasi-civilian administration that handed over the reins last year, said the army, known as the Tatmadaw, had to be involved in Myanmar s transition. Myanmar was previously hit by sanctions over the military junta s brutal suppression of the then opposition led by Suu Kyi, but Zaw Htay stressed the civilian government still has to work with the military.    The country s reconstruction cannot be done only by the government. The Tatmadaw needs to be involved, it is very clear. Everything has to undergo negotiation with the Tatmadaw under the 2008 constitution,  he said, referring to the charter drawn up by the junta before Myanmar began its democracy transition.   Sanctions and pressures affect the government s work. It won t be a positive result if they impose sanctions, as with the previous experience (of sanctions).  He added,  Of course, it will damage all the business investments, not only military-owned (businesses). It will definitely have a bad affect. There can only be bad results.  Republican Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John McCain, and Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, were among the lawmakers who have sponsored the bill.  A companion bill is also being introduced in the House of Representatives.  Members of Congress have pressed for a strong response to the plight of the Rohingya, and the Trump administration has been weighing labeling the actions by Myanmar s military as  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar has rejected that accusation, defending the military s actions as a counter-insurgency operation provoked by Rohingya militant attacks on 30 security posts in Rakhine State on Aug. 25. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar since the military crackdown that has led to reports of burnt villages and widespread killings. The United Nations has denounced it as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. Zaw Htay said Myanmar was calling for the international community to  cooperate positively  on the Rakhine issue, rather than focusing on what he called mere allegations of abuse by security forces.  We are not ignoring human rights abuses,  he said.  They are all allegations. The international diplomats and international organizations who are saying what happened are always using allegations, without evidence. No one can give strong evidence of their allegations, although we asked for it.  Myanmar had so far been unable to take action based on the claims made by refugees in Bangladesh, he said.  We will take action if they are right...So cooperate with us by showing strong evidence, rather than basing it on just allegations.  ",worldnews,0
"ALMATY (Reuters) - The sister of the Uzbek immigrant accused of killing eight people in New York said her brother might have been brainwashed and appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday to ensure he gets a fair trial. Sayfullo Saipov, 29, was charged in a federal court on Wednesday with driving a rented pickup truck down a riverside bike trail, crushing pedestrians and cyclists, in support of Islamic State. A dozen more people were injured in the city’s bloodiest single attack since Sept. 11, 2001. Trump called for Saipov to receive the death penalty. Speaking from Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, Saipov’s sister, Umida Saipova, said she hoped Trump would help ensure her brother was given “more time” and “a fair trial”. She told Reuters by telephone that she and her family had been shocked to see Saipov grow a long beard after he got married in 2013. Umida Saipova told Radio Free Europe (RFE) that her family believed that her brother may have been brainwashed. “We don’t know who has brainwashed him,” Saipova said. “Perhaps he’s become part of some organized group. I don’t know, honestly, how long it will take for his head to get rid of that poison, but I’m sure he will come to his senses, God willing.” She said she had spoken to her brother the day before the attack.  “He was in a good mood. It was a usual, good conversation,” she told RFE. Saipov’s mother, Mukaddas, told Reuters she last saw her son in August when she visited the United States. The attack was a “total shock” to the family, she said. “I was shocked by the news and I have been in hospital (since then) until this afternoon,” she said. Mukaddas said Sayfullo told her in August he missed Tashkent. She wanted to bring him home, but could not do that because his youngest child was only 20 days old, she said. Sayfullo never complained about his life in the United States and was able to support his family and help his parents at the same time, she said. “He was kind with all of his friends,” Mukaddas said. “No, he was not religious and never visited mosques because he was always busy with studying and then working.” Trump has tweeted of Saipov: “should move fast. DEATH PENALTY!” Umida Saipova told RFE she and her family hoped her brother would not be sentenced to death in some rushed show trial. Amid unconfirmed reports that the Uzbek authorities are questioning her family, she added that she did not know where her father and uncle were.  ",politicsNews,0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans on Tuesday linked repealing a key component of Obamacare to their ambitious tax-cut plan, raising new political risks and uncertainties for the tax measure that financial markets have been monitoring closely for months. In comments that infuriated Democrats and left some senior Republicans unsure what comes next, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters: “We’re optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful and that’s obviously the view of the Senate Finance Committee Republicans as well.” The finance panel, which had been in session for two days, abruptly adjourned on Tuesday as Democrats slammed the Republicans’ handling of their tax proposals, for which formal legislative language has still not been unveiled. Ron Wyden, the committee’s top Democrat, demanded more time for Democrats to discuss the issue “because we were never told that healthcare was going to be part of it and this just flew in literally out of nowhere in the last 20 minutes.” Tying Obamacare to the tax program introduces new risks for the Republicans and for President Donald Trump. Together, they have yet to score a major legislative win since Trump took power in January, even with control of Congress and the White House. The president, who has struggled in his relations with Congress, suggested in a tweet on Monday that the mandate repeal should be added to the tax plan, following up on a similar Nov. 3 tweet. No final decision on such a move was made at the Senate Republicans’ weekly luncheon, Senator Susan Collins told reporters afterward. She played a key role in July’s collapse of a years-long push by fellow Republicans to gut Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. “I personally think that it complicates tax reform to put the repeal of the individual mandate in there,” Collins said. Asked if she would back the tax bill if a mandate repeal were added, she said: “I’m going to wait and see.” Senator John McCain, who was also central to his party’s failed Obamacare repeal earlier this year, was non-committal on putting the mandate repeal in the tax plan, saying: “I want to see the whole bill before I decide.” The Senate and House of Representatives are developing separate tax-cut packages they plan to reconcile eventually and send to Trump’s desk for enactment into law, an outcome Republicans are eager to achieve so they can face U.S. voters next year with at least one major legislative achievement. House Speaker Paul Ryan, asked why the repeal of the Obamacare mandate was not in the House version of the tax proposal, told Fox News on Tuesday: “We didn’t want to complicate tax reform, make it harder than it otherwise would be.” The House had already agreed to eliminate the mandate in a healthcare bill it passed in May, he noted, adding: “We want to see the Senate go first and see if they can get that done and then we’ll discuss whether or not it’s included at the end.” The Trump administration strongly supports the House version of the tax legislation, saying its passage would be “an important first step in achieving comprehensive tax reform,” the White House said in a statement on Tuesday.      U.S. financial markets have been watching closely, with U.S. stocks rallying in recent months, partly on hopes of business tax cuts. They showed little reaction to Tuesday’s developments. The individual mandate requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty to Washington, a provision that Republicans have long opposed as government overreach. But the mandate plays a critical role in Obamacare by requiring young, healthy people, who might otherwise go without coverage, to purchase insurance and help offset the costs of covering sicker and older Americans. Underscoring the devastating consequences for Obamacare if the mandate were repealed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week that such a change would increase the number of Americans without health insurance by 13 million by 2027. The CBO added that  mandate repeal would raise the average insurance policy premiums in the Obamacare marketplaces by about 10 percent annually over the next decade. Repealing the mandate would also lower the federal deficit by $338 billion over the same time period, the CBO said, a finding that several Republican senators said influenced the move. Eliminating the individual mandate would lower the number of Americans with health insurance, meaning the federal government would spend less on subsidizing coverage for lower- and middle-income people, making that money available to pay for tax cuts. Neither the Senate nor the House tax plans now includes repealing the mandate. But both plan would add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the federal deficit and the national debt, which now exceeds $20 trillion. Congressional Republicans hope to pass tax legislation by the end of the year and are moving fast, despite uncertainties. They hold only a razor-thin 52-48 majority in the Senate. If Democrats remain united in opposition, Republicans could afford to lose no more than two senators from within their own ranks and still secure passage of tax legislation. Democrats have dismissed the Republican plans as deficit-expanding giveaways to corporations and the wealthy. Representative Lloyd Doggett, a senior member of the House tax committee, said in a statement that the House tax bill was “just a way to curry favor with Washington special interests – awarding tax windfalls to large multinational corporations and the fortunate few that sit way atop the economic ladder.” ",politicsNews,0
"KANSAS CITY, Mo./BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (Reuters) - Donald Trump has called them thugs, professional organizers and supporters of Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders. But the protesters who have stepped up their actions against the Republican presidential front-runner are a disparate group from different walks of life, with no national organization to speak of. They assemble through a patchwork of Facebook pages and myriad advocacy groups. After demonstrators swarmed a large Trump rally in Chicago on Friday and forced its cancellation over security concerns, protesters are looking for ways to keep up the momentum as the billionaire businessman seeks in primaries this week to clear a path toward the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Trump has drawn fervent support as well as harsh criticism, including from within his own party, for his calls to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Kevin Bailey, 25, who helped lead an anti-Trump protest on behalf of the Progressive Youth Organization at the candidate’s Kansas City, Missouri, rally on Saturday, said protesters had two goals - to disrupt proceedings as much as possible and signal their outrage over Trump’s divisive rhetoric. Trump spent a good part of his time on stage shouting down the protesters. Bailey said his group watched a similar protest staged by a sister organization in St. Louis on Friday as well as other protests to see if there were lessons to be learned. “We want to learn what works as far as, especially, going inside and disrupting rallies,” he said. Using smaller groups of protesters to enter rallies and station themselves around the venue, as well as staggering the disruptions to maximize their duration, are some of the strategies that seem to work best, Bailey said. Before Friday’s rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago, organizers used Facebook and worked with student groups on campuses in the Chicago area to encourage them to attend. Inside the stadium, there might have been as many protesters as supporters and a long line of people were waiting to get in when the Trump campaign scrapped the event. Skirmishes broke out between the two camps, making for some tense minutes that received national television coverage and raised security concerns around the Trump campaign.   One organizer, Nathaniel Lewis, a 25-year-old graduate student, said the cancellation was “the last thing we expected to happen. It shows the power of unity.” It happened just days before five nominating primaries on Tuesday in which Trump, 69, is trying to cement his lead over his remaining Republican rivals - U.S. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Trump’s Republican and Democratic rivals accused him of sowing tension with divisive rhetoric. But on Sunday, he said: “I don’t accept responsibility. I do not condone violence in any shape.” He called the protesters professional “disrupters” sent to his events by Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont. “Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!” Trump said on Twitter on Sunday. Trump’s campaign rallies have been boisterous, with the real estate mogul often pausing to scold protesters and ask security officers to take them away. At some events, protesters and journalists have been punched, tackled or hustled out. A 78-year-old man was charged with assault and communicating a threat after he was seen on video punching a young black protester at a North Carolina rally last week. The threat of violence affected Trump personally on Saturday. Secret Service officers rushed on stage to protect Trump when a man broke through a security barrier at a rally in Ohio. Trump said the man “was looking to do harm.” Some in the Trump camp believe the protesters’ actions in  Chicago will benefit their candidate by galvanizing his supporters.  “Some people were energized,” said Michael McKinney, 47, as he attended a Trump rally in Ohio with his family on Sunday. “I watched a lot of videos - all the protesters were throwing the first punch,” he added.     Over the weekend, President Barack Obama made a call for civility in the political process and “resolving our differences without encouraging or resorting to violence.” While young people are a visible contingent among the protesters and some are supporters of Sanders, the demonstrators are a mixed group operating in small clusters.  For a Trump rally in Bloomington, Illinois, on Sunday, Sonny Garcia, a 44-year-old facilities manager, said a loosely organized group called “Dump Trump Illinois” rallied protesters through a “Dump Trump” Facebook page. Some 2,000 people gathered. Forty members of the local chapter of a national anti-hate advocacy group called “Not in Our Town” showed up to protest,  wearing white armbands. High school student Aishwarya Shekara, 16, joined them. “I’m here because Trump stands for everything I don’t,” she said. “He’s the definition of a demagogue.” ",politicsNews,0
"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The United States is encouraged by China’s efforts to restrain North Korea but Washington will not accept Beijing’s militarization of islands in the South China Sea, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday. The comments by Mattis, during the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, show how U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to balance working with China to restrain North Korea’s advancing missile and nuclear programs while dealing with Beijing’s activities in the South China Sea. U.S. allies have been worried by Trump’s actively courting Chinese President Xi Jinping to restrain North Korea, fearing Washington might allow China a more free rein elsewhere in the region. Some allies have also expressed concern that Washington’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific trade partnership and the Paris global climate accord signals the United States is diluting its global leadership role. Speaking at the dialogue, Asia’s premier security forum, Mattis said the United States remained fully engaged with its partners.  “Like it or not, we are a part of the world...What a crummy world if we all retreat inside our borders,” he said.  “Once we have exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing,” Mattis added, paraphrasing a quotation by British wartime leader Winston Churchill. “So we will still be there and we will be there with you.” Nevertheless, reversing or slowing North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs has become a security priority for Washington, given Pyongyang’s vow to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. The Trump administration has been pressing China aggressively to rein in its reclusive neighbor, warning all options are on the table if North Korea persists with its weapons programs. “The Trump administration is encouraged by China’s renewed commitment to work with the international community toward denuclearization,” Mattis said.  “Ultimately, we believe China will come to recognize North Korea as a strategic liability, not an asset.” However, Mattis said seeking China’s cooperation on North Korea did not mean Washington would not challenge Beijing’s activities in the South China Sea. The U.N. Security Council on Friday expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea after its repeated missile tests, adopting the first such resolution agreed by the United States and China since Trump took office. In another sign of increased pressure on North Korea, Japan’s navy and air force began a three-day military exercise with two U.S. aircraft carriers in the Sea of Japan on Thursday. Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada, speaking at the Singapore forum, said Tokyo backed the United States using any option to deal with North Korea, including military strikes, and was seeking a deeper alliance with Washington. But she also said she was concerned about the situation in the South China Sea and in the East China Sea.    China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. China and Japan both claim islands in the East China Sea. LOW-KEY China, which sent only a low-key delegation to the forum,  said its ties with the United States were vital for the region. “I believe that if China and the United States can ensure no conflict, as well as maintain mutual respect, cooperation and trust, it will contribute greatly to security in the Asia Pacific and the world,” Lt Gen He Lei, the head of Beijing’s delegation, told reporters.     Allies around the world have been concerned about the commitment of the United States since Trump took office on Jan. 20 because of his “America First” rhetoric and expectations that he would concentrate on a domestic agenda. “We are still trying to figure out his (Trump’s) policy in our region,” said Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein. “I would like to know very clearly what are the true intentions of the new administration.”    Mattis sought to ease concerns for allies in the Asia-Pacific, saying the region was a priority and the primary effort was alliance building. He added, however, that countries must “contribute sufficiently to their own security.” In a sign of the U.S. commitment to the region, Mattis said that soon about 60 percent of overseas tactical aviation assets would be assigned to the region and he would work with the U.S. Congress on an Asia-Pacific stability initiative. Mattis said the United States welcomed China’s economic development, but he anticipated “friction” between the two countries. “While competition between the U.S. and China, the world’s two largest economies, is bound to occur, conflict is not inevitable,” Mattis said.  While eager to work with China in dealing with North Korea, Mattis said the United States did not accept China placing weapons and other military assets on man-made islands in the South China Sea.  “We oppose countries militarizing artificial islands and enforcing excessive maritime claims,” Mattis said. “We cannot and will not accept unilateral, coercive changes to the status quo.” ",politicsNews,0
"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to prolong for another six months the bloc s economic sanctions on Russia, imposed over the annexation of Ukraine s peninsula of Crimea and Moscow s support for rebels in east Ukraine.

Donald Tusk, the chairman of EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, said the 28 were  united on roll-over of economic sanctions on Russia.  Moscow says it will never return Crimea, which it annexed in 2014 in a move that has not been recognized internationally.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned late on Monday after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Flynn’s resignation came hours after it was reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House weeks ago that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump took power on Jan. 20. Flynn’s departure was a sobering development in Trump’s young presidency, a 24-day period during which his White House has been repeatedly distracted by miscues and internal dramas. The departure could slow Trump’s bid to warm up relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn submitted his resignation hours after Trump, through a spokesman, pointedly declined to publicly back Flynn, saying he was reviewing the situation and talking to Pence. Flynn had promised Pence he had not discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russians, but transcripts of intercepted communications, described by U.S. officials, showed that the subject had come up in conversations between him and the Russian ambassador. Such contacts could potentially be in violation of a law banning private citizens from engaging in foreign policy, known as the Logan Act. Pence had defended Flynn in television interviews and was described by administration officials as upset about being misled. “Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology,” Flynn said in his resignation letter. Retired General Keith Kellogg, who has been chief of staff of the White House National Security Council, was named the acting national security adviser while Trump determines who should fill the position. Kellogg, retired General David Petraeus, a former CIA director, and Robert Harward, a former deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, are under consideration for the position, a White House official said. Harward was described by officials as the leading candidate. A U.S. official confirmed a Washington Post report that Sally Yates, the then-acting U.S. attorney general, told the White House late last month that she believed Flynn had misled them about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador. She said Flynn might have put himself in a compromising position, possibly leaving himself vulnerable to blackmail, the official said. Yates was later fired for opposing Trump’s temporary entry ban for people from seven mostly Muslim nations. A U.S. official, describing the intercepted communications, said Flynn did not make any promises about lifting the sanctions. But he did indicate that sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama on Russia for its Ukraine incursion “would not necessarily carry over to an administration seeking to improve relations between the U.S. and Russia,” the official said. Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was an early supporter of Trump and shares his interest in shaking up the establishment in Washington. He frequently raised eyebrows among Washington’s foreign policy establishment for trying to persuade Trump to warm up U.S. relations with Russia.   A U.S. official said Flynn’s departure, coupled with Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and Syria and Republican congressional opposition to removing sanctions on Russia, removes Trump’s most ardent advocate of taking a softer line toward Putin. Flynn’s leaving “may make a significant course change less likely, at least any time soon,” the official said. Another official said Flynn’s departure may strengthen the hands of some cabinet secretaries, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. However, the second official said, Flynn’s exit could also reinforce the power of presidential aides Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, whom he described as already having the president’s ear. Congressional Democrats expressed alarm at the developments  surrounding Flynn and called for a classified briefing by administration officials to explain what had happened. “We are communicating this request to the Department of Justice and FBI this evening,” said Democratic representatives John Conyers of Michigan and Elijah Cummings of Maryland. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Flynn’s departure does not end the questions over his contacts with the Russians. “The Trump administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn’s conversations with the ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the president or any other officials, or with their knowledge,” Schiff said. The committee’s chairman, Republican Devin Nunes, thanked Flynn for his service. “Washington D.C. can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn — who has always been a soldier, not a politician —deserves America’s gratitude and respect,” he said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for prosecutors to pursue bribery charges against Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, rejecting his bid to have the case involving donations from a Florida ophthalmologist thrown out. The justices left in place a lower court’s refusal to dismiss a corruption indictment against Mendendez, who had argued that a provision in the U.S. Constitution shielded him from prosecution.  In 2015, a grand jury indicted Menendez on charges of bribery, fraud and with making false statements in his annual financial disclosure forms by failing to list gifts he received from a wealthy friend, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen.  Prosecutors allege Menendez accepted campaign donations and gifts, including a stay at a Caribbean villa and private jet flights, from Melgen in exchange for interceding in various matters on his friend’s behalf, including an $8.9 million Medicare billing dispute. Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty to the charges they faced in the 22-count indictment. Menendez argued that his actions were protected by the Constitution’s “speech or debate” clause, which offers broad protection to members of Congress against prosecution for actions they undertake as legislators. Last July, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled that Menendez’s actions amounted to “essentially lobbying on behalf of a particular party,” and thus outside the “safe harbor” provided in the Constitution.

"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will join three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups in a joint drill scheduled for Nov. 11 to 14, the South s military said on Friday.

"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian lawmakers voted through a long-delayed overhaul of the health system on Thursday that the state s Western backers say will raise standards and tackle a culture of bribe-taking in surgeries and hospitals. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund have been pressing for faster reform is a country where lives are more than five years shorter than the European average, according to the World Health Organization. But opponents of the changes, including many opposition MPs, say the more Western-style system will force patients to pay for their medicines for the first time, leaving the poorest with no healthcare. The legislation lets patients choose their own doctor, rather than have one foisted on them - a move the government said would encourage medics to improve service and give them less opportunity to demand kickbacks for treatment. The bill also sets out which medicines are paid for by the state and which ones patients will have to buy themselves. Backers have said it would be clearer than the present system, where medicines are in theory covered by the state, but patients often have to pay to get hold of pills when supplies run short. The government s task is to provide a quality medical system for citizens rather than  do nothing and tolerate the misery that we have in Ukrainian hospitals,  Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman told parliament after the vote passed. The government has been pushing for closer links to the European Union since a popular uprising ousted pro-Russian former president Viktor Yanukovich in 2014. Ambassadors from the G7 leading powers released a statement saying the legislation was  a sign that Ukraine is ready and committed to moving forward with its vital reforms . The legislation, which was steered by the United States-born acting Health Minister Ulana Suprun, has undergone 893 amendments and faced repeated criticism, including from Olga Bogomolets, the head of the parliamentary healthcare committee. Bogomolets said on Facebook on Thursday the changes would result in hospital closures and fewer doctors and medicines in rural areas, calling them tantamount to  genocide .  Supporters of the changes say vested interests who benefit from corruption in the current system spread scare stories about the reform.    Protesters camped outside parliament this week accusing President Petro Poroshenko of stalling on other legislation, including the creation of special anti-corruption courts and a move to strip lawmakers of automatic immunity.",worldnews,0
"MADRID (Reuters) - Armed police in Spain have raided several print works and newspaper offices in Catalonia in recent days in a hunt for voting papers, ballot boxes and leaflets to be used in an Oct. 1 independence referendum which Madrid vehemently opposes. The searches are part of a concerted effort by the government to prevent the ballot from going ahead, amid fears that a vote to break away could trigger a political crisis even if Spain does not recognize the outcome. On Friday, the government passed measures to tighten control over the region s spending to stop it using state cash to pay for the ballot, and earlier this week Madrid summoned over 700 Catalan mayors for questioning over their support for the vote.  They ve lost the plot,  said Albert Batet, mayor of the town of Valls and one of those summoned for questioning.  They are persecuting mayors, the press, printers. They are stretching the limits of democracy.  Catalonia s president Carles Puigdemont, who faces criminal charges for organizing the referendum, says he has over 6,000 ballot boxes ready to deploy next month, but their whereabouts are a secret.  Right now, we have no idea where they are,  said Toni Castejon, spokesman for the Catalan police force union. A spokesman for the Catalan regional government declined to say where the ballot boxes were or how the government was going to get them out of hiding to voting stations on Oct. 1. On Friday, police confiscated 100,000 campaign leaflets in a raid in Catalonia, the Interior Ministry said, without saying where. Catalonia s top court issued a warning on Friday to seven newspapers, many of them online, not to publish campaign notices for the referendum, a court spokesman said on Saturday. At the offices of Catalan newspaper El Vallenc in Valls, some 50 km west of Barcelona, six armed police knocked on the door last Saturday with a warrant to search the offices, said its editor, Francesc Fabregas. The search lasted five-and-a-half hours.  They didn t say what they were looking for,  Fabregas told Reuters, adding that he had not printed any voting papers. The raid led to an impromptu crowd gathering outside the building, with people singing the Catalan anthem and waving slips of paper chanting  Where are the ballot papers? .  When people saw that the streets had been cut off they started coming over with banners, they handed out roses to the police - the street turned into a party,  said Fabregas. For some supporters of the independence movement, the search for the ballot boxes and voting papers has become a symbol of what they see as state repression. Images of the Catalan police force - the Mossos d Esquadra - seizing what for many are symbols of democracy would be highly inflammatory, police say. The Mossos report to the Catalan regional government and are highly regarded by Catalans, particularly after their handling of the Islamist militant attacks in the region in August that killed 16. But Spanish state prosecutors have ordered all police - including the Catalan force - to act.  What no one wants is the image of the Mossos taking away the ballot boxes,  said Castejon of the police union.  That would lead to a lot of anger and even civil unrest.  Madrid has the constitutional power to take over a regional government or send in the police to force Catalonia to drop the vote, but either step would rock Spain s decentralized model of government where power is devolved to 17 self-governed regions. Although polls show less than half of Catalonia s 5.5 million voters want self-rule, most in the wealthy northeastern region want the chance to vote on the issue, causing unease that is beginning to be felt in financial markets. The Budget Ministry said that uncertainty created by the stand-off could damage the economy and push up sovereign borrowing costs. Some investors sold Spanish government bonds and switched to Italian debt earlier this week. Puigdemont and Barcelona mayor Ada Colau on Friday appealed to the Spanish government for dialogue to avert a crisis. But Puigdemont has shown no signs of backing down.  Does anyone think we re not going to vote? What kind of people do they take us for?  he said to cheering crowds from a stage in a bull-ring in Tarragona to launch the referendum campaign on Thursday.

"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Thousands of Turkish volunteers are ready to fight in Kirkuk and other Iraqi cities to defend the country s Turkmen population, the head of Turkey s nationalist opposition said on Wednesday. Devlet Bahceli said the minority Turkmen, who have close ethnic ties to Turkey, would not be abandoned in Kirkuk.  The city, home to Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens, has been controlled by Kurdish peshmerga fighters since 2014 and Kurdish authorities included it in this week s referendum for Kurdish independence in northern Iraq, angering the Baghdad government. On Wednesday Iraq s parliament asked Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to send troops to take control of Kirkuk s oilfields, raising the possibility of military confrontation.  At least 5,000 nationalist volunteers are ready and waiting to join the fight of existence, unity and peace in the Turkish cities where Turkmens live, notably Kirkuk,  Bahceli, the head of Turkey s Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) said in a statement on the party s website.  The Turkmens are not unprotected and alone. They will never be abandoned to painful ethnic genocide and statelessness. Our decision is definite, our position is clear, our word is our bond,  Bahceli said. Bahceli s party is not in government and does not set policy, but its staunchly nationalist agenda reflects the views of a segment of Turkish society which fiercely opposes the idea of an independent Kurdistan and supports Iraq s Turkmens. Turkey has the largest Kurdish population in the region and fears that the referendum in northern Iraq will fuel separatism in its southeast where Kurdish PKK fighters have waged an insurgency for three decades. Turkey s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also warned this week that Ankara would intervene militarily if the Turkmen population in Iraq was targeted. ",worldnews,0
"(Reuters) - Parliamentary elections in September showed that Russians do support their government, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. Putin cemented his supremacy over Russia’s political system when his ruling United Russia party took three quarters of the seats in parliament in Sept. 18 elections, paving the way for him to run for a fourth term as president.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said lawmakers from his party  insist  Puerto Rico be included in any supplemental federal disaster relief packages for hurricanes Harvey and Irma.  Hurricane Maria slammed Puerto Rico last week, tearing apart buildings and infrastructure, flooding communities and downing communications to nearly all of the U.S. territory s 3.4 million residents.   Puerto Rico has taken a serious punch to the gut,  Schumer said during his opening remarks on the Senate floor.  They need our help they, need it now.  Schumer also urged his constituents to add the U.S. Virgin Islands, which were ravaged by Hurricane Irma several weeks ago, and western U.S. states ravaged by wildfires to future hurricane-related federal relief packages. He asked for additional aid packages to be prepared quickly. President Donald Trump signed a bill on Sept. 8 extending the government debt limit for three months and providing about $15 billion in aid for states struck by Hurricane Harvey Hurricane Irma. Puerto Ricans are U.S. residents but they do not pay federal income tax or vote in presidential elections. There is a growing movement by residents to have their island become the 51st U.S. state, giving them more access to federal funds and the right to vote for U.S. president. ",worldnews,0
"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Greens need to compromise on immigration policy if talks on forming a new governing coalition are to succeed, the leader of the Free Democrats (FDP) said, putting the chances of a deal at 50-50. Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to form a coalition with the FDP and Greens after her conservatives lost support to the far right in a federal election last month. The three-way alliance is untested at national level.  I still see the biggest differences with the Greens,  FDP leader Christian Lindner said of immigration policy in an interview with the Rheinische Post newspaper.  Germany is at the limit of what the majority are ready to provide in humanitarian aid,  he said, adding that  realism cannot be sacrificed in a readiness for coalition.  The three parties found common ground in areas of social policy and digital infrastructure during talks on Monday, but remained far apart on issues of immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week. Lindner said the Greens did not represent the majority of Germans on the issue of family reunification - allowing foreigners to join loved ones granted asylum in Germany. That is one of the most contentious issues in the coalition talks. All the parties are eager to show the public they are taking measures to prevent a repeat of 2015, when Merkel s decision to welcome people fleeing wars and persecution led to the largest influx of asylum seekers in the post-war years. But the Greens may not accept a conservative plan to suspend the right to family reunions for asylum seekers who have only been granted so-called subsidiary protection, starting in March 2018. The Greens say that would hamper integration. Those given subsidiary protection are given one-year visas that can be renewed, because it is deemed their home country is not safe. But they do not have full refugee status that would give them the right to stay.  In the first phase, we haven t come close to solutions to conflicts,  Lindner said of the exploratory talks on a  Jamaica  coalition, so called because the parties  colors match those of the Jamaican national flag.  Therefore, I still see the chances for Jamaica at 50-50.  European reform is another area of contention between the three party groups. The FDP welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron s push for European integration and would like more security cooperation, Lindner said, but he resisted closer budget and fiscal ties.  We would like to facilitate investment in the euro area. If there is a lack of money for that, we can talk. But joint liability, common risks - whether for national debt or deposits at our savings banks, cooperative banks or private banks - there is no room for maneuver there for the FDP,  he said.

"MILAN (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday called on world leaders to work in favor of nuclear disarmament to protect human rights, particularly those of weaker and underprivileged people. The pontiff said that there was a need to  work with determination to build a world without nuclear weapons , speaking from the window of the papal apartment overlooking St. Peter s Square and citing his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si (Praised Be). His remarks came on the day that the group which won this year s Nobel Peace Prize urged nuclear nations to adopt a U.N. treaty banning atomic weapons. With rising tensions between the United States and North Korea, the pope has repeatedly warned against the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental effects of nuclear devices and has called for a third country to mediate the dispute. At his weekly Angelus prayer, Pope Francis added that men and women in the world had  the liberty, the intelligence and the capacity to guide technology, limit their power, at the service of peace and true progress . Speaking aboard the plane back from his trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh, the pope suggested that some world leaders had an  irrational  attitude toward nuclear weapons. Last month he appeared to harden the Catholic Church s teaching against nuclear weapons, saying countries should not stockpile them, even for the purpose of deterrence. Pope Francis, a strong defender of environmental protection,  also hoped that an upcoming Paris summit would adopt  efficient decisions  to contrast climate change. ",worldnews,0
"ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni s government on Tuesday called a series of confidence votes to pass a new electoral law as the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is likely to be hurt by the new legislation, pledged to protest on the streets. The government is resorting to the confidence votes to avoid secret voting in the Senate, where it has a narrow majority and at least four members of the ruling Democratic Party have said they will not cast a ballot. The confidence votes will be held by open ballot starting on Wednesday afternoon, with the final confidence vote to be held on Thursday. The government is forced to resign if it loses such a vote.  A centrist group that is not formally part of the government s majority has said it will provide up to 10 votes to help pass the law if needed. The bill, dubbed the Rosatellum, is supported by the Democratic Party (PD) and mainstream center-right opposition parties. It favors parties which group together ahead of the election.  It is likely to hurt 5-Star, which refuses to join any alliance, and left-wing parties that do not want to join a coalition with the PD. The 5-Star Movement, which tops many opinion polls, has called a street protest in front of the Senate for Wednesday afternoon, against what it sees as an attempt by its mainstream rivals to scupper its chances at the election.  It will be joined by the leftist Democratic and Progressive Movement (MDP), which split from the PD this year, and other small left-wing groups.   Apart from the PD, the legislation is supported by Silvio Berlusconi s center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the right-wing Northern League. The Rosatellum is the best compromise possible among political adversaries, according to the PD parliamentary party leader, Ettore Rosato, after whom the reform has been named. In two separate rulings, the Constitutional Court struck down previous laws, leaving the upper and lower houses with different rules. President Sergio Mattarella has called on parliament to come up with a mew electoral law that applies equally to both houses before a national vote, due by May of next year.  All previous attempts to harmonize the rules have failed, most recently in June when dissident deputies used a secret vote to up-end part of the proposed legislation. While the current law would harmonize rules for both houses, polls suggest it will not hand any coalition or party a clear mandate to govern.  The proposed election law would distribute almost two-thirds of the seats in parliament on a proportional basis, while a third would be decided in a first-past-the-post vote on specific candidates. Coalitions would need to get 10 percent of the national vote to get into parliament, while parties running alone would need only 3 percent. Candidates would be chosen by party chiefs. ",worldnews,0

"A member of President Trump s  Diversity Council  is threatening to quit because he opposes Trump s cancelation of DACA. Bye Bye!Trump diversity council member tells @Acosta he may quit the council if Trump moves ahead to end DACA https://t.co/CCn90EgSdn  CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) September 4, 2017 I want to remind him and his team that from an economic standpoint, and again, we re business people if you look at this from a purely economic standpoint again, none of these young people gets government benefits of any sorts so they re not costing us anything. They pay over $2 billion in taxes Is anyone else out there sick of the American people being told illegals cost nothing?DACA Will Cost Americans And Their Government A Huge Amount of Money.On average, people with college degrees pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. People without a degree consume more taxes than they pay to federal, state and local tax officials.In 2013, a Heritage Foundation study showed that amnesty for 11 million illegals would spike federal spending by $6,300 billion over the next five decades. That is roughly equivalent to $550,000 per illegal, or $10,000 per illegal per year, much of which will be spent when the immigrant becomes eligible for Social Security and Medicare. That cost estimate does not include the extra costs created when immigrants use their new legal powers as a citizen to bring in more low-skilled migrants.If those 3 million DACA people and their parents soon become legal residents or citizens, then Obama s DACA will cost Americans roughly $1,700 billion over the next 50 years, according to Heritage Foundation s numbers.Moreover, the DACA migrants add to the flood of illegal labor that has driven down wages for ordinary Americans, including urban youths and recent immigrants. Currently, Americans lose roughly $500 billion a year from their salaries because of the immigration tax caused by cheap labor according to the academies  report.Via: GP",Government News,1
"Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) Monday accused President Donald Trump of having a tendency to target women and people of color for his ire.Waters spoke uninterrupted for almost four minutes on MSNBC s  The Beat  about the Trump Administration s handling of the aftermath of Army Sgt. La David Johnson s death in Niger. She called on Trump and his Chief of Staff John Kelly to apologize to widow Myeshia Johnson and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D., Fla.), going on to criticize Trump s disrespect for women and minorities in general. He seems to have this tendency to talk down to people of color, to treat them with disrespect, and I think this adds to it,  Waters said.  First of all, he called [Wilson] wacky. Secondly, that he didn t back down, that he simply talked about her in a way that was not respectful I think that yes, I think this adds to the suspicion of him and the way that he thinks about minorities and black people in particular. She said Kelly was also wrong in her criticism of Wilson s 2015 speech, and she said she had the backing of the Congressional Black Caucus in saying the Trump Administration needs to do more to respect black women. All of the women of the Congressional Black Caucus have come together and we re demanding an apology,  she said.  We re sick and tired of women being undermined, dismissed, and black women, in particular, being called names. Waters also criticized Trump s overall leadership. He has the most distorted leadership of any president I ve ever known or heard about,  Waters said.  Here he had the opportunity to make the condolence call, to do it properly, to recognize this family and their grieving, and also to know the name of the soldier who had been killed. It is so unconscionable in the way that he manages his leadership,  she added.Waters also said Kelly s credibility has been damaged. General Kelly has had a good career, and to have his career basically undermined by the president of the United States because he s trying to protect the president and stand up for the president when the president did not deserve to be stood up for, now he s damaged himself,  Waters said.  He needs to call the congresswoman and apologize. ",politics,1
"Trayvon s dad sounds more logical and  Presidential  than Obama when it comes to discussing the truth about black on black crime. Maybe he wasn t so far off the mark when Obama said Trayvon could be his son?While Trayvon Martin s mother is traipsing around the country as part of Hillary Clinton s pander tour and trying to convince everyone that her sweet little angel was gunned down by a racist system, Trayvon s father actually had something intelligent to say on the issue of race. In defiance of Black Lives Matter, Tracy Martin said that the movement is meaningless as long as blacks continue to kill each other.Tracy Martin was speaking before the 30th Annual Charles W. Kegley Memorial Institute of Ethics at California State Bakersfield on Tuesday when he uttered the words that will drive BLM into a frenzy. We gonna keep killing one another. I tell people all the time that we are committing genocide,  said Martin.And then here s the thing that if a white guy said it would be considered the most racist statement ever: We re on the brink of extinction at the way these shootings and killings are going on. We keep the funeral homes and the penal system in business. When are we going to wake up? I m a realist. We can t sit up and scream that black lives matter at any other ethnicity group if Black lives don t matter to Black people,  he said.This is what I find interesting here: Black Lives Matter is a movement that was created because of Trayvon Martin s death and it is a fact that the black activists get super-pissed off when anyone suggests that black-on-black violence is more of a pressing issue than hyped up and fictionalized racism. But this is the father of the person who spawned the movement saying that blacks killing blacks is the real problem. Something s gotta give.This could cause the movement to collapse on itself, creating a racism supernova that neither race-hustling nor manufactured outrage can escape.Unfortunately not everything that Tracy Martin said was as spot-on as his black-on-black crime observation. He said the way he wanted Trayvon to be remembered was,  not as the iconic image of the hoodie, but as the African-American boy who galvanized the country. To galvanize generally means uniting people to action behind a common cause. That is the complete opposite of what Trayvon Martin s death did to this country. Besides birthing the BLM movement, the Trayvon Martin shooting and subsequent trial divided this nation along racial lines at ten times the rate of Barack Obama s efforts.Though he wouldn t use the name of the man who defended his life against a violent attack by his son, Tracy Martin characterized George Zimmerman as  guilty  and   the man who pulled the trigger and killed an innocent. And then there s this: Trust me when I say that white America can t survive without Black America,  said Martin.Never trust someone who says  trust me  they are always lying.I know that when other black celebrities have spoken on the issue of black-on-black violence, they have been shouted down by the black activists and labeled  Uncle Toms.  It will be interesting to see how the black outrage machine deals with Tracy Martin, father of the father of Black Lives Matter, saying that black lives have to first matter to black people before they will mater to anyone else.

"People have called former President George W. Bush lots of things. War criminal. Worst President Ever. Terrorist. Dipshit. F*ckface. But it is doubtful that any African-American man, woman, or child (especially after his response to Hurricane Katrina) would ever call him  my nigga. While Republicans are understandably confused by Larry Wilmore s term of endearment for the President at the Correspondents  Dinner   after all, they are used to calling him the  -er  variation of the word rather than the one Wilmore used   many view Wilmore s ability to infuriate the right in this manner as the only redeeming aspect of his otherwise godawful comedy routine. So, Mr. President, I m going to keep it a hundred. Yo Barry, you did it, my n*gga,  Wilmore said at the dinner, a phrase that most recognized as a positive remark but the Right felt was a reminder of that  n-word  thing they don t get to use when referencing President Obama.Upon hearing Wilmore call the President  my nigga,  Fox host Todd Starnes, for example, nearly exploded into a noxious cloud of rage and envy after hearing Wilmore use a variation of something that he s been screaming inside his head for years as he pretended that Wilmore s words were somehow offensive. Sharing in Starnes  feigned outrage is conservative talk show host and imbecile Jimmy Mathis, who threw an almost temper tantrum on Sunday over Wilmore s ability to use the word.Suddenly, for the first time in his presidency, Mathis feels that Barack Obama deserves  respect.  That s   the jealousy felt by the Stupid Part of America that is so pervasive that they are now talking about  respecting this President   the same one they have been screaming about for years.Mathis said that public figures like Wilmore (and, presumably, Fox News hosts and other noted right-wing icons) should   go above and beyond to try to be as respectful to the individual and the office as possible    a complete departure from what typically happens in conservative media. Mathis whined that no one called President George W. Bush  my nigga : And then you have Larry Wilmore Correct me if I m wrong, I don t remember anybody while roasting [President George Bush] dropped the N-word in the final White House Correspondents Dinner.If I were President Obama, I would have walked off that stage, I would have walked off. No way you re going to disrespect me and the office. This is not a P.C. society thing. I can t imagine standing feet from the President of the United States and saying that,  Mathis said, though like all conservatives it s probably something that is a commonly recurring theme in his dreams.Here s a thought for Mathis: right now, at this very moment in time, the Republican frontrunner is endorsed by the KKK. Until you condemn that, the rest of us   especially people you regularly dismissively call  the blacks  or worse   don t give a damn what you think about a black man saying  my nigga.

"Fox News commentator Charles Krauthammer wrote a column discussing Donald Trump s mental health on Thursday and he did not hold back.Krauthammer, who happens to be a board-certified psychiatrist, strongly rebuked the Republican nominee for viciously attacking Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala, who lost their son Humayun when he sacrificed his life to save his fellow American soldiers in Iraq. It reveals a shocking absence of elementary decency and of natural empathy for the most profound of human sorrows   parental grief,  Krauthammer wrote.  It wasn t a mistake. It was a revelation. Krauthammer then put his psychiatry skills to work, slamming Trump s narcissism and thin skin. Trump s hypersensitivity and unedited, untempered Pavlovian responses are, shall we say, unusual in both ferocity and predictability.This is beyond narcissism. I used to think Trump was an 11-year-old, an undeveloped schoolyard bully. I was off by about 10 years. His needs are more primitive, an infantile hunger for approval and praise, a craving that can never be satisfied. He lives in a cocoon of solipsism where the world outside himself has value   indeed exists   only insofar as it sustains and inflates him. Krauthammer went on to say that Trump is struggling to  pass the threshold test for acceptability,  comparing this year s election to the 1980 Election in which Reagan defeated incumbent President Jimmy Carter.  Trump badly needs to pass that threshold,  he wrote.  If character is destiny, he won t. Indeed, Trump is definitely no Ronald Reagan. Reagan spoke positively about America and the future while Trump is all gloom and doom and doesn t know when to keep his mouth shut.Krauthammer is not the only mental health professional who has talked about Trump s mental health status either.Dr. Drew Pinsky appeared on CNN earlier this week and expressed concern about Trump s temperament and impulsiveness. The question, though, is, are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected? That s a pretty hard thing to predict. I don t know if this is just somebody playing politics, or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses? When I hear people that are impulsive with their speech, I worry about hypomania and bipolar types of conditions. Pinsky went on to question the mental stability of Trump s supporters.Clearly, there is something wrong with Donald Trump and he is not fit to be president of the United States at a time when there is so much conflict and upheaval in the world. We need a steady hand at the helm, not a hand that lashes out over every little slight and criticism, especially when that hand belongs to a man who is obsessed with using nuclear weapons. Mental instability and access to the nuclear codes would be a dangerous combination.Featured Image: John Moore/Getty Images",News,1
"Melania Trump has proved over the past year that she is just as dishonest as her husband. Now it appears that she committed perjury by lying under oath about her nonexistent college degree.Shortly after she was busted plagiarizing her speech at the Republican National Convention, stealing an entire paragraph from Michelle Obama, it came to light that she was also full of sh*t when she claimed that she had graduated from the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia with a degree in architecture. In truth, Melania dropped out after her freshman year when she moved to the United States to pursue her modeling career, possibly under a visa that was less than legal. When the blatant lie surfaced, her website promptly pulled her bio.But now, it looks like she didn t just lie to the general public about having a degree, she also lied in court while testifying under oath, which happens to make her guilty of committing perjury.According to a report by Racked.com, the case involved her caviar skincare line, which never made it off the ground. The line was promoted on Good Morning America, her husband s show The Apprentice and on CNBC. But when all was said and done, the skin care products never became a reality. The contract for the line was trashed when Steve Hilbert, who was a personal friend, was fired from the cosmetic company she was working with, New Sunshine LLC.The situation eventually resulted in a lawsuit and Melania was asked to testify in court. She told the judge how angry and frustrated she was that she had worked so hard to promote the product line that the company ultimately never launched. And here s where it gets interesting.The attorney asked Melania various questions about her personal background and according to the transcripts, she was less than truthful. Where were you born, Mrs. Trump?  the attorney asked. I was born in Slovenia,  she answered. Would you please explain to the Judge your formal education including what schools you attended and from which you graduated?  the attorney requested. I attended and graduated from design school, from fashion and Industrial Design School and also attended, graduated from architecture degree, bachelor degree,  she testified under oath.Court transcripts of Melania Trump s testimony via Racked.com screen shot.As already established, this is a boldfaced lie because she dropped out after attending classes for only one year.Perjury is a criminal offense that is not to be taken lightly. Being convicted of perjury in a federal case can land you behind bars for up to five years and get you slapped with hefty fines. Perjury in state cases is punishable by a minimum of a year in jail. Republicans certainly can t stop screaming  perjury  when it comes to Hillary Clinton, but surely this fickle bunch will have no trouble ignoring it altogether in Melania s case.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,1

"A 14-year-old boy suffered a gunshot wound to the leg Wednesday (April 8) after a woman drove him and five other juveniles to a residence in Kenner to continue a fight that had occurred earlier in the day, authorities said.Police arrested the woman, Lakenya Hall, 35, of Kenner, because she instigated the fight by taking over the group of boys, which included her own 11- and 15-year-old sons, said Lt. Brian McGregor, spokesman for the Kenner Police Department.The injured teen was taken to nearby Ochsner Medical Center in Kenner where he is expected to recover.The shooting occurred just after 5 p.m. Wednesday in the 3500 block of West Louisiana State Drive in Kenner. Police learned that the teens had been involved in an earlier fight at a bus stop, McGregor said. Authorities aren t sure what the teens were fighting about.Afterwards, Hall, of 225 Clemson Place, drove six juveniles about a mile and a half away from their Lincoln Manor neighborhood to West Louisiana State Drive to continue the brawl, McGregor said.At some point, a 15-year-old boy being confronted by Hall s group pulled out a .22-caliber pistol that had been stored in a backpack and began chasing them, McGregor said. He opened fire, hitting the 14-year-old boy.Police arrested the 15-year-old boy and booked him with aggravated battery, illegal possession of a handgun by a juvenile, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, illegal use of weapons and disturbing the peace by fighting, McGregor said.Officers arrested Hall and booked her with disturbing the peace by fighting and six counts of contributing to the delinquency of juveniles. Just because you ve been in a fight, it doesn t give you the right to go over there and start a whole new fight,  McGregor said.  She s instigating something by taking the group over there in the first place. Police also arrested Hall s two sons and booked them with disturbing the peace by fighting. Investigators expect more arrests to come as they identify the other teens who were present at the time of the fight and shooting, McGregor said.Authorities have also been told that video exists of the fight, and police are working to find it.

"Because the government knows best when it comes to raising your children or something like that.A Maine mother faces child endangerment charges for allowing her daughter to play at the park across the street from her house without her constant supervision.Nicole Jensen told WMTW she often allows her three children to play at the park a few hundred feet from her house and parents in the neighborhood make a coordinated effort to watch each other s children. She watches from her front porch.But when Jensen s 7-year-old daughter was playing in the park by herself last week, someone at the park called 911 to report she was unattended and police intervened.But instead of simply walking the child home, police tried unsuccessfully to call Jensen, then hauled the girl to the police station when the mother didn t immediately answer her phone, according to the Personal Liberty blog.Jensen said she requires her children to check in every hour when they re playing outside, but police chastised the mother for not keeping closer tabs and insinuated the girl was in danger at the park. They said,  Do you know where your daughter is?  and I said,  Yes,  and they said,  Well no you don t. She s at the police station,  Jensen recalled.  (The officer) said she was at the park unsupervised, no one know where she was, and if I hadn t gotten a hold of you, I would have taken her into (the Department of Health and Human Services). Westbrook Police Chief Janie Roberts told the news site she estimated the girl was at the park for about an hour before she was detained.

"Members of a congressional committee ripped Obama and his attorney general for covering up an investigation into the death of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Terry was killed as a result of a botched government gun-running project known as Operation Fast and Furious:The House Oversight Committee also Wednesday released a scathing, nearly 300-page report that found Holder s Justice Department tried to hide the facts from the loved ones of slain Border Patrol Brian Terry   seeing his family as more of a  nuisance  than one deserving straight answers   and slamming Obama s assertion of executive privilege to deny Congress access to records pertaining to Fast and Furious.Senator Grassley accused the DOJ and ATF officials of obstructing the investigation and working to silence ATF agents who informed the Senate of Fast and Furious: The Department of Justice and ATF had no intention of looking for honest answers and being transparent. In fact, from the onset, bureaucrats employed shameless delay tactics to obstruct the investigation. One of the silenced ATF agents, John Dodson, testified Wednesday that he remains  in a state of purgatory  since objecting to Fast and Furious and has been the subject of reprisals and ridicule at the agency: That decision, the single act of standing up and saying,  What we are doing is wrong  instantly took my standing from being that of an agent of the government   to an enemy of the state. ATF and DOJ officials implemented an all-out campaign to silence and discredit me. Suffice to say, the last six to seven years at ATF have not been the best for me or my career. Grassley s and Dodson s testimony reinforced findings of the report, which states that the Justice Department knew before Terry s death that the ATF was  walking  firearms to Mexico and knew the day after the agent s death that Fast and Furious guns were involved in the shootout   despite denying these facts to the media. It goes on to state that the Justice Department s internal investigation focused more on spinning the story to avoid negative media coverage than looking into lapses by either the DOJ or ATF.The whistleblower testimony is especially compelling at the 42:00 point of the video:Several emails revealed in the report appear to indicate that some Justice Department staffers were working to keep information from political appointees at the department. I don t want to jinx it but it really is astounding that the plan worked   so far,  former Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote in an email to Holder, according to the report.The report also says that Holder s Justice Department stonewalled inquiries from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and deceptively told him that the  ATF makes every effort to interdict  firearms purchased by straw buyers. There are important reasons for not giving Grassley everything he is asking for: it would embolden him in future fights and would  use up  a lot of the material that we will eventually need to release to (California Rep. Darrell) Issa . . . as the oversight struggle continues,  the Office of Legislative Affairs Assistant Attorney General Ron Welch said in an email to DOJ colleagues.Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry died in a gunfight between Border Patrol agents and members of a six-man cartel  rip crew,  which regularly patrolled the desert along the U.S.-Mexico border looking for drug dealers to rob.Read more: FOX",politics,1
"With only three clowns left in GOP clown car, Republicans are doing everything they can to prevent Donald Trump from winning the Republican presidential nomination. During a segment on The Late Show, Stephen Colbert hilariously mocks Trump s  victory tantrum  and explains the only two ways to stop Trump from securing the nomination.Since the Republican primary race is being dominated by a has been reality TV star, Colbert appropriately likens the race to The Bachelor. Colbert lampoons Ohio governor John Kasich s claim that he can still win the nomination after his only win in Ohio. Colbert quips that Kasich would have to be made the governor of every remaining state in the U.S. in order for the candidate to have any real chance of winning the nomination.So, even though Kasich has not dropped out of the race, the only possible person left in the race who could defeat Trump is The Zodiac Killer Ted Cruz. That isn t good news for the GOP or the U.S. Cruz, while he has yet to start a race riot at a campaign event, is actually far worse than Trump in terms of policy. Cruz is also incredibly creepy. Colbert jokes at the idea of Cruz winning the Republican nomination, saying: If every single Trump voter unites behind him, he could get enough delegates to be the nominee. Then the GOP establishment can say,  Goodbye, candidate we don t like! Hello, candidate, we can t stand! If Cruz cannot secure enough votes to secure the nomination, Republicans will have one final shot at defeating Trump   a brokered convention. So if Trump doesn t get to 1,237 delegates in the first round of voting, they re all free to vote for whoever. Which is great news. The Republican campaign can start all over again, only this time it s all crammed into one week. You can binge watch the death of the GOP!

"One of the most insane things about Republican nominee Donald Trump is that even when he massively f*cks up, he can t help but brag about how  smart  and  brilliant  he is! This has been especially true when it comes to his shady tax returns, which he still refuses to release to the American people despite several promises to be transparent.If you watched the first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton last week, you saw Trump shamelessly boast about how  smart  he was for not paying federal income taxes. And after recent reports discovered that the business mogul hasn t paid taxes in almost two decades, Trump claimed to have  brilliant , superior knowledge of America s tax codes, which allows him to manipulate the system to his advantage. Well, the truth is coming out now that an ex-accountant of Trump has come forward.Jack Mitnick, one of Trump s former accountants, has given an interview with Inside Edition that exposes another one of Trump s many lies. Mitnick was the accountant cited in the 1995 tax returns that were recently leaked, where Trump was shown to have lost a staggering one billion dollars in a year. According to Mitnick, Trump doesn t even know anything about taxes, even though he claims to. Mitnick said: I did all the tax preparation. He never saw the product until it was presented to him for signature  I m the one who did all the work. This sounds exactly like typical Trump   taking full credit for the hard work of other people. The only thing Trump did that was perhaps  smart  was to hire a savvy accountant   and yet he continues to try and convince America that his knowledge of how the tax system works makes him the better presidential candidate. It s seriously pathetic!You can watch Mitnick s interview below, in which he exposes Trump as a lying fraud:Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,1

"When approached by countless people if I m a Hillary supporter, I will reply,  yes.  However, this is usually followed up with,  is it because she s a woman?  Which is the most absurd thing I ve ever heard. Sure, I m excited for the possibility of the first-ever female president, but in all honesty, it comes down to experience and ability to get the job done, which she has done time and time again throughout her career.Being tired of this question being posed, and having a decent size Facebook audience to deliver my message, I took to my page to lay out my answer once and for all.Here s my response: I can t tell you how many times I ve been asked,  are you voting for Hillary because she s a woman?  Well, to that I have to say,  no,  but if you re going ask, with that criteria, if I m voting for Hillary just because she s a woman, well, I m going to assume you re not voting for her just because she s a woman. And if you use the same attacks that Republicans have been using against her for decades, well, that means you re really no better than a Republican. And if you use her voting record against her, but then willfully ignore Bernie s anti-gun reform votes   well, sorry, you re a hypocrite. And if Hillary is the nominee this November and you refuse to vote for a Democrat or you refuse to vote, you might as well be voting for a Republican. As far as experience, don t even go there. She s clearly the most qualified person for the job. So no, I m not voting for Hillary because she s a woman. I m voting for her because she s the best damn person for the job. However, how revolutionary would it be to finally have the first woman president? It s pretty badass. And as I was going to keep this solely to my page it became apparent when Hillary was accused of ruining the Democratic party with her ambition, that this really needed to be seen again, because that is a ridiculously sexist remark. I mean, how dare a woman have the audacity to be ambitious enough to seek the White House. Is that ever asked of men? Is it? No, it s not.So no, I m not voting for Hillary because she s a woman, but I sure as hell am voting for a woman with ambition and the go-get-it attitude that she has displayed throughout her entire career. But let it be known, that if she s not the nominee for any reason, I will vote blue no matter who, because I m able to be an adult and realize the needs of the country are far more important than just the needs of my ideal candidate winning, and if a Republican wins, we all lose. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ <span>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;I can t begin to tell you how many times I ve been asked by Bernie supporters if I m voting for Hillary  just because she s a woman,  so, to make things easier, here s my response.Posted by Opinionated Democrat on Tuesday, February 9, 2016Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,1
"The father of a Virginia reporter who was shot to death last year, along with her cameraman, has some extremely strong words for Republicans over their refusal to do anything about gun violence. He reserved his most scathing words for Trump, though, who actively promotes the idea that the 2nd Amendment is under heavy assault and we re just a breath away from losing all our guns.Andy Parker, whose daughter, Alison Parker, was murdered by a disgruntled employee on television, made it his mission to end gun violence after her death. He rails at Republicans who are in the pockets of the all-too powerful NRA in an op-ed for the New York Daily News, which was a full-scale attack on them, and especially on Trump: Politicians like Paul Ryan, Mike McCaul and Bob Goodlatte know better. They re not knuckle-draggers waving Confederate flags at Trump rallies, but they still fall in lockstep behind their orange-faced Fuhrer who promotes this  assault on the Second Amendment  nonsense. Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out.  [emphasis mine] Orange-faced Fuhrer.  That s a good description. That s a fantastic description of Trump and his relationship to the GOP! Trump is not just promoting the very things that have led to increased gun violence here, he s far more likely than anybody else to become the dictator America (especially Republicans) have always feared.Parker went on to say that he d confronted Bob Goodlatte after a speech about slain police officers, in which Goodlatte never once mentioned guns, and asked him how he sleeps at night. Apparently, Goodlatte had no answer for that. Parker said,  As usual, he looked like he d swallowed a lemon. Trump and the NRA s minions in the GOP grossly insult all the victims of gun violence by fear-mongering about Democrats trying to abolish the 2nd Amendment. It s like a game to them; who can come up with the most guilt-trippy argument against sensible gun legislation? Here s what former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh did:Liberals shout  women s equality , yet they seek to strip women of their 2nd Amendment rights. #WomensEqualityDay pic.twitter.com/7vOCNocqPO  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 26, 2016How disgusting to use rape victims and women s equality as a rallying cry for their guns, guns, guns everywhere nonsense. But that s what the GOP and their standard-bearer, the Orange-Faced Fuhrer, do nonstop. They use victims of violence to expand the very thing that harmed them in the first place.Parker vows to continue the fight and move the needle on the national conversation about gun violence, and that means fighting against the GOP and the NRA. He had this to say in his op-ed, too: Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out.

"Professor Larycia Alaine Hawkins upset administrators at Wheaton College when she donned a headscarf last month to show solidarity with the Muslim community in the wake of anti-Islamic sentiment across the country. Wheaton College, which touts itself as a Christian school, also had a problem with Hawkins when she said that Muslims and Christians worship the same God, quoting Pope Francis.  In a statement, Wheaton College initiated a termination-for-cause proceeding against Professor Larycia Hawkins on Tuesday, saying Hawkins wouldn t participate in  clarifying conversations  about theological issues.Here is the Facebook post that Wheaton found problematic://  I don t love my Muslim neighbor because s/he is American. I love my Muslim neighbor because s/he deserves love by virtue of her/his human dignity. I stand in human solidarity with my Muslim neighbor because we are formed of the same primordial clay, descendants of the same cradle of humankind a cave in Sterkfontein, South Africa that I had the privilege to descend into to plumb the depths of our common humanity in 2014. I stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God. But as I tell my students, theoretical solidarity is not solidarity at all. Thus, beginning tonight, my solidarity has become embodied solidarity. As part of my Advent Worship, I will wear the hijab to work at Wheaton College, to play in Chi-town, in the airport and on the airplane to my home state that initiated one of the first anti-Sharia laws (read: unconstitutional and Islamophobic), and at church. I invite all women into the narrative that is embodied, hijab-wearing solidarity with our Muslim sisters for whatever reason. A large scale movement of Women in Solidarity with Hijabs is my Christmas  # wish  this year. Perhaps you are a Muslim who does not wear the veil normally. Perhaps you are an atheist or agnostic who finds religion silly or inexplicable. Perhaps you are a Catholic or Protestant Christian like me. Perhaps you already cover your head as part of your religious worship, but not a hijab. I would like to add that I have sought the advice and blessing of one of the preeminent Muslim organizations in the United States, the Council on American Islamic Relations,  # CAIR , where I have a friend and Board colleague on staff. I asked whether a non-Muslim wearing the hijab was haram (forbidden), patronizing, or otherwise offensive to Muslims. I was assured by my friends at CAIR-Chicago that they welcomed the gesture. So please do not fear joining this embodied narrative of actual as opposed to theoretical unity; human solidarity as opposed to mere nationalistic, sentiment. The statement above sends a message of love and tolerance and it s the college that exudes intolerance and Islamophobia by firing this courageous woman. Professors also have the right to academic freedom. One can only imagine the consequences of muzzling professors because they speak about important social issues. One of the most cherished aspects of the American way is the right to freedom of speech. Wheaton College has violated that right by moving to terminate the professor. A petition signed by tens of thousands has been circulating to reinstate the professor.Here is what Illinois Committee A on Academic Freedom had to say about Wheaton s actions: There can be no doubt that Wheaton s attempt to fire a professor for expressing support for Muslims is an attack on academic freedom. But what few have realized is that this bigotry also an attack on the Christian values of loving thy neighbor that Wheaton pretends to embrace. The administration at Wheaton is not just betraying the values of freedom that every true college must stand for, they are also betraying the values of Wheaton College itself. Here is Professor Hawkins  graceful response on the move to terminate her: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SRRq3SdcBo] Show your support for Professor Hawkins by signing and sharing this petition.Featured image: screegrab",News,1
"Mind blowing incompetence and reckless disregard for the lives of these brave men and women by politically appointed leftists A new service award recently created by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for Border Patrol agents could actually put their lives at risk. The award recognizes an agent who does not use deadly force in a situation where they are confronted by an armed assailant.  They want us to put ourselves in a bad tactical situation,  National Border Patrol Council Vice President Shawn Moran told Breitbart Texas in an interview Friday evening.  This could lead to one of our agents getting killed. The award is defined by the CBP as:The Use of Deadly Force Encounter Averted award is to recognize and employee who demonstrated clear situational awareness and courage while disarming a suspect using contact controls and verbal commands before the situation escalated to the use of deadly force. The act must demonstrate courage in the face of an armed suspect and result in no injury in accordance with agencies use of force policy. At first, I thought this was a joke,  Moran told Breitbart Texas. But Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera contacted officials in the awards section of CBP and they confirmed it is true, he said. In addition to his Border Patrol duties Cabrera also serves as vice president of NBPC Local 3307 and as NBPC deputy spokesperson. This is a true indication about how the politically appointed leaders of the CBP truly feel about our agents,  he said.Moran said he had not heard about the award before Cabrera brought it to his attention.  I can t recall any official discussions between the union and the department over this,  he explained.  This is typical pandering by our executives to organizations like the ACLU and illegal alien advocates. The exacerbated leader of the NBPC which represents more than 18,000 men and women who protect our nation s borders said,  They are more concerned about placating these groups than protecting Border Patrol agents. He said this is also typical for them to roll something like this out on the day before a big holiday weekend hoping no one will notice.The policy appears to put just one more thing an agent must think about when faced with a life threatening situation.The NBPC posted a copy of the award definition on its Facebook page earlier on Friday evening. Commenting on the award, the organization posted,  This type of thinking will get Border Patrol agents killed. If that happens we will hold the creators of this award accountable. This is despicable. The CBP seems to be following the lead of the Los Angeles Police Department who rolled out a  Preservation of Life Award.  The policy was designed to recognize officers who hold their fire to avoid using deadly force, Breitbart News  William Bigelow reported in November 2015.The Los Angeles Police Protective League had a similar reaction to that of the NBPC. The local police union responded that the award prioritizes the lives of suspected criminals over the lives of officers.NATO forces in Europe considered a similar idea but never implemented it, Bigelow reported.

"Meeeeoowwww The comments below by Ivana Trump were totally out of line and rude. Ivana is promoting her new book but it s only a turn-off when she behaves like this to Melania. Who wants to support anything this snarky woman promotes? The rude comments go on and on First Lady Melania Trump wasted no time in responding. We give her credit she called it exactly what it was:  attention-seeking and self-serving noise Ivana Trump said she should be considered the  first lady  because she was President Trump s first wife, prompting a stinging rebuke from third wife and current first lady Melania Trump that the remark was  attention-seeking and self-serving noise. Ivana, the mother of Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric, said she has a line to the White House but tries not to call Trump too often because it makes Melania Trump jealous Ouch!Ivana Trump to @arobach: I don't like to call POTUS at the White House: ""I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy"" https://t.co/SiTlUUDX2S pic.twitter.com/nyvSj3Wk9O  Good Morning America (@GMA) October 9, 2017THE FACT THAT IVANA THINKS SHE WOULD CAUSE ANY JEALOUSY IS LAUGHABLE! I have the direct number to White House, but I no really want to call him there because Melania is there,  Ivana told ABC s  Good Morning America  during an interview on Monday.  I don t want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that because I m basically first Trump wife. MELANIA WASTED NO TIME RESPONDING: Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President. She loves living in Washington, DC, and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books,  spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to CNN.  There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex, this is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise. Ivana Trump, 68, who married Donald Trump in 1977 and divorced him in 1992, has been making the rounds of talk shows to promote her memoir,  Raising Trump,  which was published on Tuesday.WHAT A B*TCH! IVANA THINKS IT MUST BE  TERRIBLE  FOR MELANIA TO BE IN WASHINGTONDespite her comment that she should could carry the mantle of  first lady,  Ivana Trump said she really wouldn t be happy in the White House and wouldn t be willing to change places with Melania. I think for her to be in Washington must be terrible,  Ivana Trump said.  It s better her than me. I would hate Washington.

Can I give the speech for 45 minutes without [a] teleprompter? Absolutely. Can I read a contract? Can I negotiate? Can I entertain? Absolutely. But I would not really like to be there. I like my freedom,  she said.Ivana also takes  full credit  for raising their three children because he was  on the telephone making the deals. He was a loving father, don t get me wrong, and he was a good provider, but he was not the father which would take a stroll and go to the Central Park or go play to baseball with them or something,  she said,  It was only until they were about 18 years old [that] he could communicate with them, because he could start to talk business with them.

"Since the Reagan administration, Americans have been sold a bill of goods that tells us that inherited money is more valuable than earned money. Republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation, while for the most part, Democrats disagree. The compromise has been that only estates valued at a whopping $5.45 million or more ($10.9 million for married couples) are taxed. Anything below that is completely tax free.Now, Hillary Clinton, after prodding from Bernie Sanders and his followers, has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when I say Donald Trump s children won t be happy.Previously, Clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks to its 2009 levels, pushing up the rate from 40 percent to 45 percent, and making it kick in for estates worth at least $3.5 million (today, it only hits those valued at $5.45 million or more). But, no longer. Instead, she s borrowed a page from her formal primary rival, and now proposes turning the levy into a progressive tax meaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estates with a top rate of 65 percent. The last time the estate tax hit that level was in 1982, though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances.Beyond all that, Clinton has said she would largely do away with the step-up in basis at death, a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that, say, their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before passing away.In the end, the committee expects these measures to raise about $225 billion over ten years.Source: SlateAs it stands, the estate tax system is a joke. In 2012, a staggering $1.2 trillion was passed down as an inheritance. Of that, less than 1 percent was taxed. As for the Republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses, in 2013, only 20 small businesses and family farm estates, in the entire country, had to pay estate taxes.The other common Republican argument is that estate taxes are  double taxation  (as if every other dollar in the American economy hasn t been taxed multiple times), but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains, which are also unlikely to have every been taxed.Of course, even if Clinton is elected, she ll have a tough time passing this, at least as long as Paul Ryan is in charge of the House. He wants Trump s kids to pay zero in estate taxes. Of course, for all we know, Trump himself pays zero in taxes.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.",News,1
"Obama made Wall Street out to be the enemy during his presidency. He bashed them on one hand then supported them with the other Speaking out of both sides of his mouth is a true talent Obama has. He counts on the people to forget and forgive his misdeeds and they do. Who else could get away with so many lies? Remember when he called Wall Street every bad name in the book? Fat Cats?He also said,  At some point you ve made enough money We d like to know what  enough money  means to Obama who s taking 400K for his speech at a Cantor Fitzgerald event in September. We think it s time for Obama to practice what he preaches and  spread the wealth . It s only fair, right?OBAMA WANTS TO GET IN ON THE ACT THE CLINTONS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR DECADES   BIG MONEY SPEECHES ARE THEIR BREAD AND BUTTER: OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON SPEECHES THE CLINTONS HAVE GIVEN: Thank God she has a vagina, otherwise her blatant hypocrisy might be an issue with voters Hillary Clinton is facing more questions about her close ties to Wall Street financial institutions. Last week, the New York Times urged Clinton to release transcripts of her highly-compensated speeches to Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs.The paid speeches are just a slim chapter of her relationship with financial titans. According to Clinton Foundation records, Wall Street financial institutions have donated around $40 million to the eponymous family foundation.As a non-profit, the Clinton Foundation isn t legally required to disclose its donors or contributions. The Foundation has publicly disclosed some contributions on its website. It only provides ranges for contributions, e.g. $1-5 million, and doesn t detail when the contribution was made or for what purpose, if any.Four major Wall Street institutions stand out; Barclays, Barclays Capitol, Goldman Sachs and Citi. Each are listed as given between $1 million and $5 million to the Foundation. Citigroup, UBS, Banc of California and Bank of America are listed as giving up to $1 million to the Foundation.[/buttonAll together, contributions from readily identifiable Wall Street institutions to the Foundation total somewhere between $11 million and $41 million in contributions. If we assume the donations fall in the middle of the ranges disclosed by the Clinton Foundation, the contributions would total just under $30 million.As with most things involving the Clintons, the devil is in the details. This total of contributions does not include those made by individuals with strong Wall Street ties. It also does not necessarily represent the total amounts contributed to the Foundation from those donors listed. It only accounts for the donations which the Foundation has chosen to disclose.The failure of the Foundation to include any information on the timing of the donations is especially worrisome. In terms of donor relationships, there is a real difference between a one-time gift of $1 million and an ongoing gift of $200,000 for 5 straight years. The total dollar amount may be the same, but an ongoing gift usually requires a more substantive relationship between the Foundation and the donor.There is, of course, an added dimension to the timing issue with the Clintons. During the life of the Foundation, Hillary Clinton has been a US Senator, Secretary of State and two-time candidate for President.When the Clinton Foundation discloses that the  Friends of Saudi Arabia  contributed $1-5 million, it begs the obvious question of when that donation was made. The specific date of that donation is particularly important, given Clinton s considerable focus on the Middle East while she was Secretary of State.It is also important to note that these contributions are completely seperate from the paid speeches made by Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 2013 alone, Hillary earned just over $3 million in paid speeches to financial firms and institutions.These contributions, obviously, also don t include direct contributions made by Wall Street institutions and individuals to either of Clinton s Presidential campaigns.For entire story: Breitbart News",politics,1
"Donald Trump s paranoia and desperation to keep the American people in the dark just took an unconstitutional turn.For weeks, various news outlets have obtained inside information from White House sources such as memos and descriptions of what is going on behind the scenes. That s how we know about what executive orders Trump is considering and how we know about the chaos and infighting that has been plaguing Trump s administration. It s also how we know more about Trump s Russia scandal.Rather than address his executive orders or the chaos in the White House or his Russia scandal, Trump would rather whine about the leaks instead.The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by  intelligence  like candy. Very un-American!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017You know what is really un-American? Forcing your staffers to hand over their phones for an inspection.According to a report by Politico, White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer actually confiscated the phones of his staff to go through them in order to make sure they are not leaking any information to the press.Of course, if someone had refused to hand over their phone they would have more than likely lost their job so they definitely didn t volunteer to give their phones up. They had to do it out of fear.The staffers were called to an  emergency meeting  and told to place any electronic device they had on them on a table, including personal cell phones, so they could be searched.But the Constitution specifically bars such illegal searches and seizures.The Fourth Amendment states, The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. In other words, if Trump really thinks the leaks are  illegal,  he should have to get a warrant to search the phones of his employees. But he didn t, which means his search is illegal and in violation of the constitutional rights of his staffers. Trump and Spicer can hardly call the confiscation voluntary either since many of these staffers probably believed they would be fired if they did not hand over their phones. That means they were forced to do so, and they can file a lawsuit for having their privacy violated.Once again, Donald Trump and his team are violating the Constitution. Republicans in Congress cannot continue to allow Trump to trample our constitutional rights. It s time to investigate and impeach him.

Cavaletto and  Keith Wheeler, filed a bill  HB6064  to deny any form of state aid to a child, if that child does not have a  father s name  on their birth certificate. The proposed law makes an allowance for another family member to be substituted who will provide financial support for the child if a father can t or won t be listed.A portion of the bill reads as below: Provides that if the unmarried mother cannot or refuses to name the child s father, either a father must be conclusively established by DNA evidence or, within 30 days after birth, another family member who will financially provide for the child must be named, in court, on the birth certificate. Provides that absent DNA evidence or a family member s name, a birth certificate will not be issued and the mother will be ineligible for financial aid from the State for support of the child. Source: ChicagoistSo basically what Republicans are trying to do, it seems, is completely abolish all welfare by either saying you don t need it (because you have a financial benefactor listed) or you don t get any because you don t have someone to pay for your child s needs. What the hell kind of logic is that?This is not the first time Republicans have attempted to actively sabotage the lives of women and children who are in the most desperate of need. Last year, State Rep. Jeanne Ives made remarks along a similar theme during a budget-related debate: You need to have verifiable need. You better know who the daddy is and whether or not he can afford that child and whether or not the taxpayers should be funding that or if there s actual child support he can provide. Source: ChicagoistA verifiable need   like not having a known father to ask for help? Is this real? It s so comically absurd that it literally satirizes itself.If there is a bright side to this insult to women and humanity, it s the fact that the bill will likely die a quiet and quick death in the house due to the Democratic supermajority that Illinois currently has to protect it from these evil people.Think about it this way. Republicans would outlaw all contraception and abortion, even in cases of rape. A woman undergoes that heinous assault, and she can t get an abortion because Republicans  love life too much  to let her make that choice on her own. After 9 months of getting no help with prenatal care or the hospital bill when she gives birth, Republicans would immediately deny that child they  protected  from abortion any form of state assistance for the next 18 years.Pro-life, indeed.Featured image via Youtube",News,1
"How many more days remain in our Community Organizer In Chief s term in office? He can t make golfing his full time job fast enough This week, former CIA director Gen. David Petraeus testified on Capitol Hill, warning that inaction in Syria carries risks for the United States. Russia s recent military escalation in Syria is a further reminder that when the U.S. does not take the initiative, others will fill the vacuum   often in ways that are harmful to our interests,  Petraeus said.FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE   Russian, Syrian and Iranian military commanders have set up a coordination cell in Baghdad in recent days to try to begin working with Iranian-backed Shia militias fighting the Islamic State, Fox News has learned.Western intelligence sources say the coordination cell includes low-level Russian generals. U.S. officials say it is not clear whether the Iraqi government is involved at the moment.Describing the arrival of Russian military personnel in Baghdad, one senior U.S. official said,  They are popping up everywhere. CNN Report Sept. 8, 2015:The Russians already have been building up their military presence in Syria, a subject expected to factor prominently in a planned meeting between President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin in New York Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.While the U.S. also is fighting the Islamic State, the Obama administration has voiced concern that Russia s involvement, at least in Syria, could have a destabilizing effect.Moscow, though, has fostered ties with the governments in both Syria and Iraq. In May, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi flew to Moscow for an official visit to discuss potential Russian arms transfers and shared intelligence capability, as well as the enhancement of security and military capabilities, according to a statement by the Iraqi prime minister s office at the time.Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani also was spotted in Baghdad on Sept 22. He met with Shia militias backed by Iran; intelligence officials believe he met with Russians as well.Meanwhile, a U.S. official described to Fox News how, over the weekend, the Russians were able to move 24 attack jets into Syria undetected.The Russian military flew 12 Sukhoi Su-25  Frogfoot  and a dozen Sukhoi Su-24  Fencer  attack aircraft in  tight formations  under the  steady stream  of the large Russian An-124 cargo planes that have been ferrying supplies from bases in Russia through Iran before traveling on to Syria, the official said.The large cargo planes appeared as  a big blip  on radar, but flying beneath them were  tight formations  of the smaller Russian fighter jets that used jamming pods and switched off their IFF, which would identify the aircraft to radar.The large Russian cargo planes have the capability to fly directly from Russia to Syria, but the smaller attack aircraft do not. The Russian jets did not have the legs to make it directly from Russia to Syria, and needed a base to refuel,  said the official, who spoke to Fox News under the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose sensitive information.According to the Aviationist, the Russian cargo planes and fighter jets landed at an airbase in Hamadan, Iran, roughly halfway between Baghdad and Tehran on Sept 18-19.Fox News also has learned from U.S. military sources that the Russians have begun flying some of the Sukhoi fighter and attack jets from Bassel al-Assad airport, in Latakia, now a Russian forward operating base along the Mediterranean.The planes are not dropping bombs or conducting attack missions, but just flying around near the base, according to one official. The official also confirmed that Russian destroyers are in position off the Mediterranean coast.On Thursday, State Department spokesman John Kirby denied a U.S. intelligence failure led to U.S. officials being caught unaware of the two dozen Russian warplanes arriving in Syria. I can tell you that we ve been watching this very, very closely   and we have not been ignorant of what the Russians have been doing,  said Kirby.Asked Thursday about Russia s military involvement in Syria, Defense Secretary Ash Carter cautioned that without Russian support for a  political transition  in Damascus, it could  pour gasoline on the ISIL phenomenon rather than to lead to the defeat of ISIL. But just two days ago, Secretary of State John Kerry said the Russian build-up was consistent with defensive measures. For the moment, it is the judgment of our military and most experts that the level and type represents basically force protection, a level of protection for their deployment to an airbase given the fact that it is in an area of conflict,  Kerry said at the State Department Tuesday.

"The Donald Trump supporter who viciously assaulted an African-American protester at a recent campaign rally gave a terrifying interview to Inside Edition, and it confirms what many of us have sensed for a long time: It s only a matter of time before someone gets killed at a Trump rally.TV s Inside Edition caught up with the cowboy hat wearing Trump fan after the rally and asked him about why he sucker punched a young black man as he was being escorted out of the stadium. The man, whom police have identified as 78-year-old John McGraw, was all smiles. He beamed as he told the camera:  You bet I liked it. Knocking the hell out of that big mouth. When asked why he needed to punch the 26-year-old, McGraw let his crazy fly at full force: We don t know if he s ISIS. We don t know who he is, but we know he s not acting like an American, cussing me. If he wants it laid out, I laid it out. McGraw believes the African American protester was from ISIS. However, his delusional bloodlust didn t end there. He went on to say that the man  deserved it  and warned that  next time we see him, we might have to kill him.  He again reiterated the idea that the man was a terrorist.The victim, Rakeem Jones, was reportedly sore but fine after the incident. However, police at the event decided to arrest him instead of McGraw.McGraw s violence is just another example of a disturbing trend at Trump rallies. As protesters continue to bravely come out to interrupt the Republican front-runner where ever he goes, his fans have taken to physically assaulting them. Based on McGraw s statements, the violence is inspired in part by delusional conspiracies gleaned from Fox News and the GOP that pretends Islamic terrorists, black people, and liberals are working together to destroy America. As such, people like McGraw feel no remorse for attacking them.Don t believe it, just let him tell you himself.Featured image via screen capture from Inside Edition",News,1

"A fired up Hillary Clinton addressed members of the Democratic Party at a dinner in Columbus, Ohio two days before the primary there, and issued a call to rhetorical arms for the battle against Donald Trump and his racist and bigoted presidential campaign.Clinton went on the record with some of her strongest comments about the reality star turned Republican presidential front runner, just two days after his violent supporters caused the cancellation of a campaign rally in Chicago. Donald Trump is running a cynical campaign of hate and fear, for one reason: to get votes,  she said.  He s encouraging violence and chaos to get votes. He is pitting Americans against each other to get votes. As the Washington Post reports, Clinton s comments mark a  sharp escalation  in the tone of the former Secretary of State s about Trump. And she wasn t done there. After stoking every fire he can think of, Trump encourages his supporters to beat up anybody who disagrees with him   literally punch them in the face   and then offers to pay their legal bills,  Clinton said.In 2012 when President Obama successfully ran for re-election in an atmosphere of right-wing demagoguery, he often told audiences who booed at the prospect of Mitt Romney becoming president,  don t boo, vote.  Clinton offered her version of the phrase in her speech: You and I know Donald Trump is not who we are,  she said.  Of course, we can criticize and protest Mr. Trump all we want. But none of that matters if we also don t show up at the polls. She added:  If you want to shut him down, then let s vote him down. Some observers have worried that Democrats are not turning out to vote in the primaries in the same numbers as Republicans have been, and wondered if that will spill over to the general election, where Democrats have historically had a slight edge in turnout over the Republicans. But Trump s comments and overall campaign tone seem to have energized the core Democratic voters   women and minorities   needed to take the party s nominee to victory.Coupled with recent, direct denunciations of Trump s harmful rhetoric from Bernie Sanders as well, the left seems  fired up and ready to go.

"Obama doing what Obama does best putting radical Muslims who are a serious threat to our national security back on the battlefield against America The Obama administration has released from the Guantanamo Bay prison an al Qaeda terrorist who served as terror mastermind Osama Bin Laden s personal bodyguard, according to an announcement by the Defense Department.Abdel Malik Ahmed Abdel Wahab Al Rahabi, a top terror operative who had planned to participate in the 9/11 attacks and who received training to be a suicide bomber, was freed from Gitmo and transferred to Montenegro.Al Rahabi is just the latest accused terrorist to be released from prison by the Obama administration as it pursues an end-of-administration effort to clear out Gitmo and shut it down.The release was condemned by some in Congress who have opposed the administration s efforts to shutter Gitmo. The administration is playing Russian roulette with America s safety by releasing 9/11-plotter Abdel Malik Ahmed Abdel Wahab Al Rahabi from Gitmo,  Sen. Mark Kirk (R., Ill.) said in a statement.  Rehab s transfer abroad is all the more alarming after terrorist Ibrahim al-Qosi resurfaced in December 2015 in the Arabian Peninsula as the top recruiter for al Qaeda after being transferred from Gitmo to Sudan.

"After Donald Trump declared that he would do far worse things than waterboarding, it has left the questioned to be begged, what should be done to gain intelligence that doesn t involve torture? A very valid question, and one that our intelligence community probably grapples with daily considering, no, you can t torture people to gather intelligence.When posed with this question on CNN, Ben Carson replied that he would promote a much more humane  medical way  of intelligence gathering.Pressed on what this medical way would be by CNN s Poppy Harlow, Carson responded: I believe there are a number of ways to extract information. Including, you know, some medical ways of, you know, putting people into a less than conscious state which allows information to be extracted much more humanely. Carson was then asked to explain further, so he said: Well, the average person might understand it as truth serum. But, you know, there are ways where you decrease a person s conscious defenses and they might be much more willing to give up information. Seemingly perplexed by the concept of a truth serum as though it were coming from a Harry Potter novel, Harlow again asked Carson to explain in greater detail what he means. Carson explained: Sodium amytal, but you know there are a variety of different things we can use now. We ve made some advances in that kind of science. So, instead of torture people, Carson is advocating drugging them against their will. It may seem more humane, but it s not necessarily more ethical.Carson never did actually answer the question regarding if waterboarding should be used, and pivoted away into a non-answer of  I don t think we necessarily need to be broadcasting what we do. Well, okay then. Why answer questions anyway? It s not like he s running for Commander-in-Chief or anything.Watch the interview unfold here:Featured image: YouTube",News,1
"Vice President Joe Biden followed up Senator Elizabeth Warren s attack on Donald Trump with a sternly-worded condemnation of Trump s attacks on the federal judge overseeing the Trump University fraud case.Biden: Trump's comments on judge ""reprehensible"" and ""racist"" #inners https://t.co/d5ZRduVO8J  All In w/Chris Hayes (@allinwithchris) June 10, 2016 I find Donald Trump s conduct in this regard reprehensible,  the vice president said.After detailing how Trump had gone after the judge for ruling against him with ethnic slurs and the promise to use the power of the White House for revenge should he be elected, Biden noted such an action would  border on an impeachable offense. Biden said Trump s taunting of the judge was a  direct threat  to  defy  the court if he were elected president, and a clear sign of a tyrannical mindset proving Trump  cannot be trusted to respect the independence of the Judiciary as a president.

It is the strongest condemnation to come from the executive branch on Trump s behavior.Biden also pointed out that despite Republicans condemning Trump, they are still holding up the nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court seat vacated after the death of Antonin Scalia. Biden specifically mentioned that even the Republicans who admitted Trump was being racist are still working on behalf of him being the one to choose the next justice.The remarks come on a day of major Democratic unity, as President Obama announced that he was endorsing Hillary Clinton and would begin campaigning with her. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she would endorse Clinton and Governor Martin O Malley also announced that he would back the former Secretary of State. While Sen.

"Celebrated Congressional Black Caucus member, and  legend  Corrine Brown would like Americans to believe that stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from underpriveleged children in her district, and using the money to vacation with her daughter, is not the reason she s been found guilty of 18 counts of fraud and corruption, it s because she is black. Washington Examiner   She partied with Nancy Pelosi, traveled on Air Force one next to President Obama, and cast her superdelegate vote for Hillary Clinton. But on February 9, 2017, Corrine Brown was in federal court for stealing scholarship money from school children.The disgraced congresswoman attempted to defend against charges that she funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars from a non-profit charity, One Door for Education, into her own pocket.After her former chief of staff testified against her, the question was no longer whether or not she s guilty. It s why Democrat brass would continually cozy up to a congresswoman who was so clearly corrupt?From the beginning, Brown s been shrouded in controversy. Shortly after she won election in 1992, the Federal Election Commission accused Brown of violating numerous campaign finance laws. Most notably, she accepted donations from foreign citizens and failed to report the use of a corporate plane. And that s just the tip of the ethical iceberg.A convenient rap sheet, put together last July by the Florida Times-Union, documents every allegation of wrongdoing brought against Brown during her 27-year career. Hollywood couldn t have better scripted some of the highlights.In 1998, Brown cashed a $10,000 check from Rev. Henry Lyons, the disgraced president of the National Baptist Convention who spent five years in federal prison for fraud. The congresswoman said tthat she used the unreported money to bus her supporters to an event.In 2000, Brown battled back a House Ethics investigation into her efforts to free imprisoned West African millionaire Foutanga Dit Babani Sissoko from federal prison. She appealed to Attorney General Janet Reno for help, asking her to spring Sissoko from prison. Though unsuccessful, Brown received a new Lexus worth $50,000 for her trouble.And in 2008, Brown took heat from the mayor of Jacksonville after she had sandbags delivered by the city to protect her home from Tropical Storm Fay. The congresswoman eventually pledged to pay the city $886.But none of this dissuaded Democrats from palling around the Florida woman. It s mind boggling that Brown not only fundraised with the president but also enjoyed prominent perches on the Transportation and Veteran Affairs Committees.First Coast News   On Thursday, November 16, 2017, the former Jacksonville area Congresswoman Corrine Brown took the stand, and plead for mercy from federal judge Timothy Corrigan. I am sorry you have to be here today to see me in this situation,  Brown said in her statement to the court.  I never imagined I would one day be in court asking people to speak on my behalf   never. In hindsight, I wished I had been more diligent in overseeing my personal and professional life The idea that some people could believe these charges hurt me because it runs contrary to everything I ve ever believed and done in my life. I hope and pray these proceedings to don t make them [ordinary people] lose faith in the system. I humbly ask for mercy and compassion. Brown was convicted on 18 counts of fraud and corruption in May.The lead prosecutor in the sentencing hearing argued Thursday that the former congresswoman should be sentenced to about 7.5 to 9 years in federal prison. Her defense attorney is seeking probation and community service.Brown s defense attorney James Smith objected to various aspects of the sentencing recommendations, including how much money Brown should be culpable for.Prosecutor Duva asked the court,  What accountability does the law require?  during his presentation.Duva said Brown was accustomed to receiving money she should not have received. She also lied about donations to colleges, churches and other entities.He also argued that Brown has made ludicrous comments during the investigation, including a comment where she essentially said that had investigators not been looking into her case, the Pulse shooting in Orlando would never have happened. She also referred to the charges as  bogus  and  racist,  implying that she was targeted for her race in the case.Duva objected to that notion by saying,  She was targeted because she committed fraud, not because she was black or white. Corrine Brown had several witnesses come forward Thursday in support of her through witness testimony during the sentencing hearing.Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee provided a glowing character witness of Corrine Brown during her sentencing hearing Thursday.Jackson Lee described via telephone testimony it as her  privilege  to characterize Corrine Brown as a  loving person. She said Brown has had a  pointed and direct effort [in] helping others, not herself. The veterans  community loved Congresswoman Brown, Jackson Lee said, stating that Brown has helped those with PTSD and other issues following fighting overseas. She also stated Brown helped tremendously with relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. That shows a character of giving to others unselfishly,  Jackson Lee said.Additional arguments by defense attorneyThe defense attorney belabored the point that they are against the notion that Brown abused a position of trust, which is established by the evidence presented in the trial.Smith explained the definition of obstruction of justice, which Brown is accused of doing while taking the stand by the prosecutor, stating that it is the  intention or deliberate effort while on the stand to make material falsehoods. The judge wasn t so sure and asked the defense attorney to elaborate.Smith appeared to get emotional after posing two questions:  What type of sentence does justice require in this case?  and  How do you sentence someone who is a legend? He attributes some of her actions to the progress our country has made in terms of relations for black people.Smith said he met with an Orlando attorney who was from Jacksonville and said the attorney described Brown as  our Martin Luther King  for black Jacksonville natives. None of those people had to push the boulder up the mountain like she did,  said Smith, referring to others in Congress.  She truly is a legend. There are a lot of moving parts in the case against Corrine Brown and her co-conspirators.Carla Wiley first became involved in the fraud scheme when she started dating Ronnie Simmons.She was president of a charity called One Door for Education, which was never actually registered as a 501(c)(3).The fake charity received more than $800,000 in four years, with about only $1,200 of it actually going to scholarships for students. That money is now gone.Simmons was dating Wiley when he told her he needed a nonprofit to financially back a reception for congresswoman Brown in 2012. Wiley offered One Door for Education as an option for that reception.The charity claimed to give scholarships to poor and underprivileged children seeking the become teachers.Lead prosecutor A. Tysen Duva argued during the trial that Ronnie Simmons worked under Brown and did her bidding by taking out $800 a day from the One Door for Education bank account and depositing it into Brown s personal bank account. He did this numerous times, according to Duva and evidence released earlier this month.The fake charity was essentially used as a slush fund for Corrine Brown s travels, expenses and shopping, according to the prosecutors.She used the money put in her bank account to go to Nassau, Bahamas with her daughter, fly to Beverly Hills and shop along Rodeo Drive, and attend a Beyonc  concert, according to court documents and previous reports by First Coast News.The prosecutors also argued that Brown committed wire fraud, mail fraud and stole money from the government after she lied on tax documents.Brown had friends in high places, such as former CSX CEO Mike Ward. She would ask them for donation to Open Door for Education and many of them gladly donated, according to previous reports and prosecutor testimony.Ward, for instance, contributed $35,000 to One Door for Education after learning that the money would go toward providing students with iPads for learning.Prosecutors also argued that Brown lied about and inflated what she gave in tithes to various churches. The churches came forward in the trial and said the donations claimed to be given by Brown did not match their records, to which Brown said she sometimes gave anonymous donations.Other legitimate scholarship organizations came forward and said they had never received funds from Brown s charity.Meanwhile, Brown s tax returns claimed she contributed as much as $30,000   20 percent to a third of her income, to various charities.",politics,1

"Donald Trump has become increasingly paranoid and frustrated as the investigation into ties between his 2016 presidential campaign, his outside associates, and perhaps even himself and the Russian government heats up. There have already been two rounds of subpoenas issued to Trump s disgraced National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, regarding this matter. Further, it doesn t help that Trump s own White House is leaking like a sieve to the New York Times and the Washington Post regarding the chaos within   especially when it comes to the handling of the Russia matter. Things are so worrisome at this point that Trump has already hired outside lawyers to represent him. So, how is Team Trump planning to handle all the scandal that continues to plague their White House? Why, they are going to wage war on investigators and leakers   for years, if necessary.Axios is reporting that Trump will have his  street fighters  devise a plan to target leaks from within the intelligence community and other parts of the government with zeal, and they also have come to realize that the Russia investigation is not going away just because they want it to. They cannot fire or lie their way out of this one, and the press isn t going to let go of a story this big. According to a Trump-backer, they are ready for this fight: The White House is embracing the fight, which is going to last as long as Donald Trump is president. We re getting street fighters ready to go. Axios has also obtained a detailed a  war room  plan regarding this escalating war between the White House and the rest of the government:The thing is, though, that the Trump White House can t even function on a day to day basis. They aren t even staffed up like a normal White House would be by now. The same goes for other major administration agencies, such as the State Department. Further, the chaos inside barely allows the staffers to get anything at all done other than try to control Trump s television time, feed him positive news so that he doesn t go off the rails too often, and to control his tweeting   which they seem to be failing miserable at.The idea that these incompetent wannabe authoritarians are any match for the apparatus of the United States government is downright laughable.

Sally Kerns wants since she has introduced several anti-gay bills this year as part of her ongoing hate crusade against gay people.The most egregious bill of the three is HB 3044, which forbids school officials from referring gay students in crisis to councilors or therapists who would actually treat them like human beings.According to Slate,The bill states that no public school  counselor, therapist, social worker, administrator, teacher or other individual  can  refer a student under the age of eighteen  to any  individual, organization or entity  if the referral  pertain[s] to human sexuality.  In fact, public school counselors can t even  provide the contact information, business card, brochure or other informational materials  of a gay-friendly organization to students.The only way students would get to see gay friendly therapists is if they notify their parents, which would out them as being gay, thus making the situation worse and opening themselves up to further ridicule and bullying that could push them over the edge.But that s not the only bill Kerns is pushing to persecute gay people.HB 1598 would protect ex-gay conversion therapy, even though the American Psychiatric Association opposes it. And this bill works perfectly with HB 3044 because it would funnel gay teens to anti-gay therapists who would likely pressure their patients to enter such a program.And then there is SB 733, which would ban anyone with HIV or other  communicable or infectious diseases  from getting married.These bills are specifically designed to discriminate against gay people. And the laws are particularly cruel toward gay teens who need understanding and caring professionals to talk to instead of hateful people who will only make things worse. It s like Republicans are literally trying to make sure these kids commit suicide and that should make every parent sick despite how you might feel about homosexuality.Featured Image: Children s Advocate",News,1

"Water stations are set up along marathon courses with the understanding that the water is for the runners. We think this group of looters didn t get that memo. They blatantly go about stealing the cases of water right in front of everyone. Hugh Brasher, Event Director for London Marathon Events Ltd, said:  It s very disappointing to see water being stolen in this way from the official water stations for our runners   These water stations are staffed by volunteers and we are very grateful to them for their work on Race Day.  We always brief our volunteers not to get into altercations if this kind of thing happens. We ll investigate this further.  ",left-news,1
"At a town hall in Frost, Texas last week a voter expressed concerns about violence against women   but Rep. Joe Barton was not interested in hearing them.The constituent asked Barton to work with Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat, to sponsor legislation that could combat violence against women   a topic that has not much interested the Congressman in the past: Given your voting record opposing legislation protecting women from violence, will you make a commitment to us today, make a promise that you will reach out to Congresswoman Jackie Speier and work with her to see this bill successfully through Congress? Barton says he voted against the bill because he believes violence targeting women   which happens literally everywhere   is a  state issue, not a federal issue. His audience was not pleased. The crowd responded with a chrous of boos. Violence against women, that s a national issue!  one person yelled in response.  That s an issue that impacts everyone everywhere, not only in this country, but everywhere! But Barton wasn t done. Pointing his finger at the man who had the audacity to suggest that he take a moment to care about women, he demanded: You, sir, shut up. You don t tell anybody to shut up!  the man shouted back.  You work for us! Close to 1,000 people attended the town hall. It s safe to say that most of them left knowing for whom they are not voting in the next election.

"According to the Center for Immigration Studies, in 2012 approximately 51 percent of all immigrant households collected welfare: HOW THE USDA Helps Illegal Aliens Get FREE Benefits Paid For By YOU! This is a problem. A lot of American households also collect welfare, and that is a problem as well.A liberal newspaper claims it has obtained copies of two of President Donald Trump s upcoming executive orders that if implemented would once and for all stop immigrants from leeching off the American taxpayer.Obtained by The Washington Post, the orders would reportedly  deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge  and set up standards for  determining whether an alien is deportable   for having become a public charge within five years of entry. The underlying goal would be to make the U.S. immigration system more  merit-based,  so those with the potential to contribute to the country would be welcome, whereas those more likely to be a burden to the American taxpayer would be kept out.According to New York magazine, the order would also  bar undocumented immigrants from accessing the child tax credit, even when their children are U.S. citizens,  which would be a huge blow to illegal immigrant families hoping to cash in on their anchor babies.The simple fact is that as a sovereign nation, the United States reserves the right to demand the very best from anyone who aspires to live here. It is a fact that the U.S. actually has much more lenient immigration policies than a large number of Western countries that liberals profess to admire. Try immigrating to Canada or Western Europe if you don t believe it.If an immigrant works hard, obtains citizenship and leads a good life but is later laid off and needs to collect welfare for a bit, that s one thing. But when someone immigrates here and then immediately boards the welfare train, that is another   and it s a problem that President Trump hopes to finally resolve.For entire story: Conservative Tribune",politics,1
